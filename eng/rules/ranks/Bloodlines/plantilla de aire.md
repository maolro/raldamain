## Rank I

You gain resistance 1 to physical damage. 

<u>Stormborn:</u> You have resistance to electrical and thunder damage equal to your staff rank. You suffer no penalties to your movement from powerful winds and can withstand an additional turn if you are drowned.

<u>Aerokinesis:</u> Your elemental heritage allows you to alter winds. You unlock the ranks of air elemental magic. As a bonus action you can create a cool breeze that will last as long as you maintain concentration. You can have no more than one active breeze and it can be used to do one of the following effects (you can only do a single effect per turn).

- A creature receives an advantage or disadvantage die on rolls against extreme heat, fire attacks or gases.
- Reduces or increases a creature's area of smell by 10 feet. 
- Pushes a light object that is not grappled 10 feet. Not propelled with enough force to do damage.
- Expands a fire by 5 feet or extinguishes 5 cubic feet of fire.

## Rank II

Increases your DES by 1.

<u>Hawk's Eye:</u> You suffer no penalties to your vision from fog and storms. You may suffer 2 non-lethal damage to infuse one of your ranged attacks with wind, ignoring penalties from storms and powerful winds. If there are no winds or they act in your favor the infused attack will do +2 base damage. A creature with wind magic cannot use Elemental Parry to protect itself from an infused attack.

<u>Wind step:</u> You can take an additional move action per turn. Your jump speeds increase, being able to jump an additional 10 feet horizontally and 5 feet vertically. 

<u>Cushion of air:</u> Winds protect you from deadly falls. If you fall from a great height you receive a glide speed equal to 30 feet, allowing you to move horizontally in a fall. You can spend a move action to encourage your fall, causing you to fall only 60 feet for one turn. You do not suffer fall damage upon impact with the ground if the winds strength is 2 or more. You can also avoid damage by employing a standard action at the time when you hit the ground.

## Rank III 

You gain Resistance 2 to physical damage. 

<u>Enveloping winds:</u> As a standard action you can surround yourself with a shield of raging winds. An entire 10-foot area centered on you counts as difficult terrain and any creature entering it must roll FUE against your elemental magic (CAR if you don't have any) or it is pushed back 5 feet. You receive resistance to projectiles equal to your elemental template Rank while you have this ability active (this resistance will not apply against projectiles of large or larger size). You may take 1 non-lethal damage to increase the radius of Protective Winds by 5 feet for one turn or reduce the speeds of all creatures entering the area by 5 feet. You cannot have this ability active for more than one minute at a time and it disappears upon loss of concentration. 

<u>Elemental connection:</u> You are always surrounded by an air bubble, which allows you to breathe underwater or in a void for 10 minutes at a time. When you start your turn in an area affected by a storm or winds of level 3 or higher you recover 1 Vitality. You cannot heal your HP in this way, but by taking a short rest in an area with a high presence of your element (high places or places affected by high storms) you recover all your HP as if you were taking a long rest. 

## Rank IV 

Increases your CAR by 1.

<u>Sky traveller:</u> You receive the ability to fly 60 feet as a move action. While flying you gain a die advantage attacking creatures on the ground and increase your DES by 1 for Dodge rolls. This flight speed is reduced by heavy armor and you will begin to fall if you are stunned. Flying long distances tires you more easily, leaving you fatigued if you try to fly for more than an hour at a time.

<u>Infused attacks:</u> Your physical attacks are infused with the force of a raging tempest. Upon hitting with a physical attack you automatically push the target 5 feet and can employ 2 perks generated in a natural attack to Fintar. If you have ranks in Storm Magic you will inflict +1 electrical damage on physical attacks and you can spend 2 perks to Slow the target (4 perks to Stun). Status effects made with Infused Attacks ignore resistance to Stun and Slow, but resistance to electrical damage applies against them.

## Rank V 

You gain Resistance 3 to physical damage and Magic Resistance equal to your Rank - 2.

<u>Element of freedom:</u> You gain resistance to being Grabbed or Entangled equal to your Rank in elemental staff. Your speed is not reduced by difficult terrain and you can move normally underwater. If you have the Freedom of Movement skill then you receive immunity to being Grabbed or Entangled.

<u>Sudden speed:</u> A number of times per day equal to your Template Rank - 2 you can propel yourself with air to move at high speeds. When using this ability all your speeds increase by 15 feet for one turn and you will not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving out of a confrontation. Add one challenge die to your defensive Dodge rolls during that turn.

## Rank VI

Increases your SAB by 1.

<u>Elemental form:</u> As a full turn action, you surround yourself with a powerful gale which gives you the appearance of a gigantic air elemental. While in elemental form you are constantly surrounded by a Wall of wind and the strength of the winds in a 20-foot area centered on you increases by 2 (maximum 5). Your elemental attacks receive one Advantage die for each level of strength the winds have (does not stack with Awaken the Storm if you have that ability). Each turn you maintain elemental form you suffer 1 Vitality damage and lose the Elemental Connection ability. The elemental form fades if you lose concentration or are incapacitated.
