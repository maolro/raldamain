The Raldamain system is an innovative role-playing system that aims to be easy to use and with infinite possibilities. Unlike other systems, there the concept of classes does not exist in Raldamain and it is usable for all kinds of fantasy worlds with minimal adjustments. The basis of character creation is in the rank system, where the player can select a set of atributes to build a character concept. 

## The six statistics

All ranks revolve around six basic stats, which will be detailed in this section. These measure how many ability dice you roll on all skill rolls related to that statistic. The six statistics are as follows:

- **Strength**: Strength (STR) measures the character's physique. Strength rolls are those that require physical effort, such as swimming against the current or escaping from a grip. This statistic is key for ranks related to heavy weapons, martial arts or similar. If you have 4 or more strengths the base damage of your weapons increases by 1, and increases again by 1 if your strength is 6 or more.
- **Dexterity**: Dexterity (DEX) measures a character's agility and accuracy. Dexterity rolls are those related to precise or agile movements, such as moving stealthily or walking on narrow surfaces. This statistic is key for ranks related to light weapons, ranged weapons and reflexes. Dexterity allows you to dodge attacks as a reaction, for which you roll your DES dice in a defensive manner. 
- **Constitution**: The Constitution (CON) measures the character's health. With this statistic you calculate your VP and Vitality (seen in the next section), and although there are no Constitution skill rolls nor is it related to any specific skill, it is recommended to have a good value in it. You roll your Constitution dice in a defensive way to protect yourself from poisons and diseases.
- **Intelligence**: Intelligence (INT) measures the character's knowledge and memory. Intelligence rolls are those related to searching for information and remembering information. This statistic is key to arcane magic and knowledge ranks.
- **Wisdom**: Wisdom (WIS) measures a character's intuition and insight. Wisdom rolls are those that require the senses or the need to act on instinct. This statistic is key to the divine magic and Tracking ranks, and you roll your Wisdom dice defensively to protect yourself from mental and moral effects.
- **Charisma**: Charisma (CHA) measures a character's eloquence and will. Charisma rolls are those related to convincing or deceiving. This statistic is key to elemental magic, in addition to the ranks of Influence and Presence. Charisma can replace Intelligence or Wisdom in some rolls if you have the right attributes.

At level 1 you have the values 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 to distribute among your six stats. In addition, you can reduce one of your stats by 1 to increase another by 1 (maximum 3). Every time you increase an even level (2, 4, 6...) you can increase one of your stats by 1, reaching a maximum of 6.

## HP, Vitality and Defense

The next step to create a character is to determine the Health Points (HP), Vitality and Defense (DEF). These three values are essential for a combat and measure the character's endurance capacity.

- **HP**: HP measure the health of the character and his ability to endure lethal damage. They are equivalent to 3 + WITH at level 1, and increase again by 1 every time you go up 3 levels (i.e. at level 4, 7, 10, 13...). When a character's HP are reduced to 0, he becomes dying and falls unconscious if his Vitality has also reached 0. A dying character will lose 1 VP at the beginning of his next turn until he receives healing, and dies if his negative VPs become equal to his negative WN (e.g. a character with 2 WN will die if he reaches -2 VP). 

- **Vitality**: Vitality measures a character's physical endurance capacity. Vitality is equal to 2 + WITH + the character's level. Vitality is reduced by non-lethal damage, plus cold and necrotic damage. If a character's Vitality reaches 0 he becomes Fatigue and all non-lethal damage he suffers becomes lethal damage. 

- **Defense**: Defense is a value that reduces the damage you suffer. Defense depends on the armor you wear and your natural armor (humans start with 0 natural armor). Light armor gives you DEF 1, medium armor DEF 2 and heavy armor DEF 3. More information about armor can be found in the section on Armor Fitness

  This is different from Resistances, which reduce the damage you receive from a specific type of attack. For example, Fire Resistance reduces all fire damage you receive by a certain value

HP and Vitality values are reduced or increased if you suffer any change to your WITH statistics. With a short rest you recover all your Vitality and HP equal to your level/3 (rounded up), while with a long rest you recover all your HP and Vitality.

## Skills

Skills represent your proficiency in various skills unrelated to attribute ranks. Your proficiency with a skill is marked by your talent level, which ranks from 0 to 5. At level 1 you have four talent levels to distribute (maximum of 2), and at each level thereafter you receive an additional talent level. 

## Ranks

Ranks form the basis of the Raldamain system. You get 2 ranks of your choice at level 1, and at each subsequent level you receive an additional rank in an ability. You cannot have an ability ranked higher than your level by 2 (i.e. at level 5 you cannot have an ability ranked III). With the consent of the master a player can slightly modify the skills that a rank gives without altering numerical values.
