## Permanent wounds

Permanent wounds are designated as all wounds that cause lasting damage to a person's body. Inflicting permanent wounds requires spending a number of perks according to your weapon Rank on impact with an attack.

Depending on the type of damage your weapon inflicts, permanent wounds have slight variations. If your weapon is Blunt, the target will suffer Bleeding in addition to the effects of the wound. If it is Blunt, you can inflict permanent wounds on armored creatures even if your damage is reduced to 0, while if it is Piercing you are able to inflict permanent wounds on naturally armored creatures even if they reduce your damage.

The wound you inflict will affect a random part of the target's body unless you spend a number of perks to target a specific location. If you suffer a permanent wound again in a place where you already have one, increase the level of the wound by 1. The permanent wounds that affect each part of the body are the following:

### Head

Aiming for the head requires an additional cost of 2 perks. If you are hit in the head, make an additional 1d10 roll to determine if you suffer an additional wound to your eyes, ears, or neck. The effects you receive from being hit in one of these parts of the head depends on the type of permanent wound you have suffered.

**Mild:** You are staggered for one turn. In addition, add one Disadvantage die to all your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma related skill rolls.

**Medium:** Adds one difficulty die to all your INT, WIS and CHA rolls. You are stunned for one turn and remain staggered until you receive healing, in addition to the effects caused by a minor permanent wound. 

**Severe:** Adds two difficulty dice to all your INT, WIS and CHA rolls. You fall Unconscious until you suffer damage or are awakened by a creature. If you suffer an additional permanent head wound you will suffer brain damage, which will kill you in one turn if you do not receive healing. Even if you are healed, you receive a mild insanity of the master's choice.
