title: Combat rules
---

The combat rules of the Raldamain system aim to speed up combat and favor strategy over luck. Combat is divided into units of time known as rounds in which creatures may take appropriate actions in the order dictated by priority. 

Actions are divided into three types: movement actions, standard actions and full turn actions.

## The turn

### Standard action

A standard action is the most important action of a turn, and can be used to attack or cast spells. You may not take more than one standard action per turn unless an ability allows you to do so, and you may spend a standard action to take an additional movement action. 

Instead of using your standard action, you can save it for use at a future time. This allows you to use your standard action as a reaction at any time during combat. If a saved action interrupts another action, the saved action takes precedence unless the attacker has caught you by surprise or feints you. Saved actions are lost at the beginning of your next turn.

### Movement action

A move action requires less effort than a standard action and has a versatility of uses. Initially you can only perform one move action per turn which can be used for one of the following options:

- Move a maximum number of feet equal to your movement (usually 15 feet). If you are fighting an enemy and you move out of his range, he will make an attack of opportunity on you.
- <u>Disengage:</u> You will not provoke attacks of opportunity for one turn by moving out of the area threatened by your attacker.
- <u>Defensive Position:</u> Add one Difficulty die to all your defensive rolls for one turn. If you spend a standard action to enter a defensive stance, convert one of your Difficulty dice to a Challenge die in addition.

You can spend two generated advantages or disadvantages to perform a movement action outside your turn (4 advantages to perform a standard action) as long as you have unused actions left. You can also perform an additional move action once a turn by suffering 2 non-lethal damage, which will not reduce your priority value.

### Full-round action

A full turn action requires more effort than a standard action. If you perform a full turn action you will lose all movement actions you have in your turn. Performing a ritual costs you a full turn action. You will not be able to use movement actions by spending perks or taking non-lethal damage.

### Bonus actions

A bonus action is one that requires so little effort that it does not consume any other type of action. This type of action does not reduce priority when used. 

A creature can move 15 feet as a bonus action, which will provoke an attack of opportunity if it enters another creature's area.

### Reactions

Reactions are all those actions you perform outside of your turn. Both defensive shots and attacks of opportunity fall into this category.

#### Defensive rolls

Defensive shots represent how a character defends herself against an attack made against her. The defender must declare which method he uses to protect himself and will roll the corresponding dice. When dice are rolled defensively they will be transformed to their respective negative dice in the following way: an Ability die becomes a Difficulty die, a Solidity die becomes a Defiance die and an Advantage die becomes a Disadvantage die.

Any creature can defend itself using the Parry and Dodge reactions. Dodge represents using agility to avoid an attack and can be used to avoid ranged and area attacks, while Parry represents blocking a melee attack using any object capable of doing so. The Dodge roll is equal to the DES statistic of the creature thrown defensively while the Parry roll depends on the size of the object used to parry the attack, being at least 2 Difficulty dice.

#### Opportunity attacks

An opportunity attack is an attack used as a reaction. These are provoked by a multitude of factors and abilities, these being the most common. 

First, an attack of opportunity is provoked if a creature retreats from a confrontation without employing a move action to disengage. These attacks represent that the fleeing creature drops its guard and is vulnerable to attack. Only Dodge may be used to ward off an attack made in this manner. This attack is not provoked by retreating from an enemy that is being flanked.

An attack of opportunity can also be provoked if a creature saves its standard action to use it later. An attack saved in this way will have priority over the enemy, although the enemy will be able to defend normally. If a creature saving action is hit by a ranged attack or a surprise attack it will lose all its saved actions and the round will continue normally.

## Additional factors

### Cover

A person has cover when he is behind an obstacle that allows him to protect himself from projectiles and explosions, making him more difficult to spot. If a character has cover he can cancel one additional success per turn on Dodge rolls and can use movement actions to hide. When a creature with cover enters a defensive position it can cancel an additional success per turn if it continues to be behind cover. For an obstacle to count as cover it must be equal to or greater than one quarter the size of the creature and be blocking line of sight. The master has the final say in deciding whether something counts as cover or not.

Cover bonuses will also apply if there are other creatures between the attacker and his target. A character that receives cover by this effect will not be able to hide and will not be able to cancel an additional success to the turn unless there is a creature of a larger size blocking the attacker's path.

Superior types of cover may be encountered in certain situations. If a creature has all of its body covered except for a small opening it will receive superior cover, which allows it to cancel two additional successes per turn. If there is no overture between the attacker and his target he will have full cover, which will protect him from all attacks until the cover is destroyed.

### Flanking

A creature is flanked if it is being attacked from two opposite points. When attacking a flanked creature the attacker will receive an Advantage die on his shot and the defender will not be able to Dodge to defend himself. Sneak attack applies against flanked creatures and the defender will only be able to avoid these penalties if he has the attribute Improved Awesome Dodge.

If a creature is surrounded by a marabout it will only be able to use Dodge or Parry against those enemies on its front flank. Attacks made by a marabout against a single person count as area attacks, as the defender will suffer mandatory damage even if he succeeds in the attack.

### Concealment

A creature has concealment when it is difficult to perceive because of fog, darkness, or similar effects. Concealment increases the chance that attacks will miss, adding one Disadvantage die to its defensive rolls for every 10 feet of distance between it and the attacker. A creature with concealment cannot receive ranged attacks if it is more than 60 feet away. This distance is reduced to 15 feet if the creature is in magical darkness, heavy fog, or terrain with heavy cover (this type of concealment is known as superior concealment). All attacks you make against creatures unable to perceive you will count as surprise attacks, adding an Advantage die to your attack rolls and preventing them from being able to roll to defend themselves.

Concealment penalties can be countered by spending Advantages on an attack roll. Each Advantage spent will remove one Disadvantage die and increase the maximum distance by 10 feet. Those creatures that carry light or attract attention will not receive any advantage for concealment.

### Joint Attack

A group of low level creatures can make a joint attack against a more powerful enemy, joining forces to defeat it. The base damage of the joint attack will equal the highest base damage among the fighting creatures with an increase of 1 for each additional creature participating. The attack shot equals the highest attack shot among the creatures performing this maneuver and will increase as follows according to the number of participants.

| Number | Extra dice                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 2      | +1 ability die                       |
| 3      | +1 proficiency die, +1 ability die   |
| 4      | +1 proficiency die, +2 ability dice  |
| 5      | +2 proficiency dice, +2 ability dice |
| 6      | +2 proficiency dice, +3 ability dice |
| 7      | +3 proficiency dice, +3 ability dice |
| 8      | +3 proficiency dice, +4 ability dice |

A joint attack counts as an area attack, inflicting damage even if the defender succeeds in the shot (Evasion applies against this effect), and the defender can only protect himself with Dodge. The defender may spend a use of Parry to reduce the damage he suffers by 2, reducing it to at least 0. If the attackers are flanking the target then the target will not be able to use Dodge to defend himself or use Parry more than once per turn. 

### Falls

Falls represent the damage that a character will suffer from hitting an object at excessive speeds. This damage is only reduced by resistances to physical damage, ignoring both artificial and natural armor. A falling character will suffer 1 blunt damage for every 5 feet of distance he falls, which will ignore natural armor. This damage will become non-lethal. If your target falls a certain number of feet he will suffer permanent wounds as indicated in this table.

| Feet  | Permanent injury   |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 5-10  | None               |
| 15-20 | Mild               |
| 30-45 | Medium or 2 mild   |
| 50-65 | Severe or 2 medium |
| 70+   | 2 severe           |
