Of all the esoteric and forbidden tomes that exist in the world none of them comes even close to the legendary Necronomicon, a book so vile and infamous that for a long time it was believed that all copies in existence were destroyed. Written in time immemorial by [Abdul Alhazred](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/abyssals/abdul_alhazred.html), the Mad Poet, this book contains all kinds of blasphemous secrets relating to mostrous creatures beyond human understanding and ancient magic from distant ages and worlds. A reader ill-prepared for the content of this tome has the risk of going irreparably insane, or worse, falling under the control of the book's sinister writer.

# History

An accurate history of the Necronomicon is a nearly impossible task as the book's origins are lost to time and those who have attempted to investigate more about it have irreparably gone insane. It is believed that most copies in the material plane have been destroyed but those mad enough to seek it can recieve the book from the Mad Poet himself, who lives on in the deepest layer of the [Dreamlands](https://raldamain.com/en/locations/dimensions/dreamlands.html) waiting to share his dark knowledge with unsuspecting mortals. 

The only known example of someone gaining the book from the Mad Poet was the case of [Julian Rais](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20imperialism/julianrais.html), a notorious serial killer from Raldamain who travelled to Alhazred's domain in 4028 and obtained the infamous tome by giving him the memories of his companions as a gift. Rais would then use the tome to commit many vile acts such as tricking others into dragging parts of the material plane into the Dreamlands or summon aberrant monsters to wreak havoc on humanity. 

# Abilities

The Necronomicon contains vast lore about the Dreamlands and the Abyssal realms within its pages, revealing many unspeakable secrets which will  make its reader question their very existence. It also has information about many powerful rituals such as those to travel between dimensions, summon abberrant creatures or even contact [Abyssal lords](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/abyssals/). While this powerful knowledge seems tempting to many, the power of the book will shatter the minds of those too weak to handle its contents and many have fallen to madness before gaining full knowledge of the book's power.
