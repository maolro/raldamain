Of all the esoteric and forbidden tomes that exist in the world none of them comes even close to the legendary Necronomicon, a book so vile and infamous that for a long time it was believed that all copies in existence were destroyed. Written in time immemorial by [Abdul Alhazred](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/abyssals/abdul_alhazred.html), the Mad Poet, this book contains all kinds of blasphemous secrets relating to mostrous creatures beyond human understanding and ancient magic from distant ages and worlds. A reader ill-prepared for the content of this tome has the risk of going irreparably insane, or worse, falling under the control of the book's sinister writer
