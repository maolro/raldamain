title: Cup of wrath
---

The death of a god is a harrowing and age-changing event, often bringing devastating consequences to the mortal world. Even though a god may die parts of their essence might still live on, but to the dissapointment of their former followers they are often corrupted by the trauma of the god's untimely demise. One of the most well-known examples is are the Cups of Wrath, deadly artifacts that contain the blood of the [First God](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/first%20gods/) [Antaka](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/first%20gods/Antaka.html), lord of the undreworld. The liquid inside these cups is among the deadliest materials in the world as the dead god's blood is imbued with their boundless hatred and despair, killing all who would dare even gaze at it.

# History

When the god of death Antaka was betrayed and slain by his fellow god Yinamu most of their essence was siphoned by their murderer, leaving nothing behind but their bodily remains. The blood spilled by Yinamu would fester in the Underworld, becoming poisonous and vile as it filled with the dead god's feelings of revenge and guilt. This corrupted blood would later be found by Shade who in a moment of vile inspiration created several beautiful drinking cups from Antaka's corpse and filled them with the dead god's blood, creating the first Cups of Wrath. 

These cups would be intentionally spread throught the material plane to cause death and despair to all mortals unfortunate enough to find them. While they are deadly to most humans, a few powerful necromancers can use the blood in dark rituals to achieve immortality as undead liches or spread the taint of the Shadow Realm to the world of mortals. The current wherabaouts of the Cups of Wrath are unknown but for the good of humanity is is better that they remain hidden.

# Abilities

The Cups of Wrath are beautiful to behold, made of precious metals and ivory with intricate designs engraved throughout their surface. This will abruptly change when the cups are activated, becoming nearly organic and growing three baleful eyes that will gaze on whatever unfortunate soul dared disturb the dead god's blood. 

Once the cup has had a long and careful look at its target they will begin to feel sick and faint as the god's blood begins to form inside them, sentencing them to a painful death. The blood is as toxic as the world's deadliest poisons and its exact efects depend on the victim, causing madness, mutations or even melting them from the inside.
