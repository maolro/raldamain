Known as the book of universal truths, the Taurenet is the collection of revelations the prophet [Mekhatim](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20triumph/mekhatim.html) had as she wandered the Kajmasar mountains after her exile. According to Mekhatimist belief she recieved those revelations from the angel Ithanatron himself, who showed her deep truths about the origin of the universe and the moral laws that govern it. While many copies have been made of this book, the original tome is said to be infused with powerful [celestial](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/celestial%20host/) magic and it can reveal powerful magical secrets to those holy enough to fully understand it.
