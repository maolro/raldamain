Believed to be written by [Sek-Tebos](../../../creatures/superior beings/infernals/sektebos.md) himself, the sinister tome known as the Codex Infernalis contains a vast collection of occult knowledge ranging from demonology to arcane secrets. It is believed that this book holds the secrets of eternal life and arcane mastery, but as with everything related to Sek-Tebos there is always a catch which inevitably leads to damnation and eternal servitude to the demon god. This book was once considered holy in the days of the [Rakashite empire](../../../ideas/nations/rakashite.md) and after its fall the Codex was taken by the founders of the [Cult of Sek-Tebos](../../../ideas/religious groups/sek-tebos cult.md), who have kept the book ever since and used it to perform unspeakable rituals and gain powerful magic originating from hell itself.
