Originally carried into battle by the prophet [Mekatim](../../../characters/age of triumph/mekhatim.md), this powerful artifact has been part of the Arshalani royal family for generations and is a powerful symbol of the might of the prophet herself. The banner sits behind the Mhayid's throne in times of peace,  always radiating a faint golden glow as a sign of the [Celestial Host](../../../creatures/superior beings/celestial host.md)'s favor. But when war threatens the [Arshalani empire](../../../ideas/nations/arshalan.md) tradition dictates that the Mhayid must take the banner from its place and kneel before it, asking their prophet's blessing just as the [first Mhayid](../../../characters/age of triumph/canrim.md) did when he first charged into battle. Only the holiest monarchs have the right to use the banner in battle as the prophet did so long ago, using its great power to smite all infidels who threaten the might of Arshalan and the Celestial Host.
