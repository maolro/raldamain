One of the three great artifacts created by the [Godslayer](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20gods/syd.html), the Infinity Cube is capable of magnifying its wielder's magical abilities, rendering them capable of great deeds or horrendous atrocities. Its exact workings are a great mystery and only the greatest mages are capable of unraveling its secrets to unleash its massive power. Nowadays the cube exists only as a legend after it vanished from the face of the earth along with its latest wielder, the notorious archmage [Nox](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20succesion/jace.html), but the desire of obtaining near-unlimited power inspires droves of wizards to search for this artifact or even try replicate it.
