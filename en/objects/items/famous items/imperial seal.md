title: Imperial Seal
---

A symbol of the separation between both worlds and the authority of the Shinri Emperor, the Imperial Seal is a great stone tablet inscribed with the peace agreement accepted by the [First Incarnate](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20succesion/firstincarnate.html) and the [Primal Spirits of Shinri](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/primal%20spirits/shinri/). But this tablet holds more than mere words as the ancient spirits gave part of their essence to honor their deal and entrust the Imperial Seal with power over both worlds. As long as the Imperial Seal remains in good hands [Shinri](https://raldamain.com/en/locations/natural/shinri%20region.html) will remain in balance, but if someone would use its power for immoral purposes the land itself would be threatened with a new era of chaos and suffering.

# History

To end the Great Spirit war the First Incarnate and the primal spirits of Shinri made an agreement that would separate both worlds and ensure the spirits would be worshipped and respected in exchange of letting humanity live. Their contract was inscribed in a stone tablet, forming what is now known as the Imperial Seal. As part of the peace agreement the primal spirits gave part of their essence to the First Incarnate, who sealed it inside the tablet as a guarantee that they wouldn't break the terms of their deal. For the remainder of his life he held the seal as symbol of his triumph and role as guardian between both worlds, entrusting it to his descendants once it was up so they would countinue his noble work.

While the First Incarnate's intentions were noble he did not anticipate that the Seal along with the many powerful artifacts he left behind were capable of dominating and controlling the Spirits themselves. This property was discovered by the [Seishin-Gumi](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/factions/seishingumi.html), a secret organization created by the First Incarnate to protect Shinri from threats from both worlds. The order's new leadership believed that humanity could harness the power of the Spirits to achieve greatness and for this goal they forced many great spirits to give part of their essence to many of Shinri's great families, thus forming the first [Ekta](https://raldamain.com/en/magic/bloodlines/ekta.html) clans. This act angered the Great Spirits but there was little they could do since the terms of the Imperial Seal stopped them from directly intervening and those who showed even a little resistance would be sealed by the Seishin-Gumi.
