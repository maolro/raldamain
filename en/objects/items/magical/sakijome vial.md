The Sakijome or memory vials are tiny and strangely durable glass vials made according to traditional [Shinri](https://raldamain.com/en/locations/natural/shinri%20region.html) glassblowing techniques from the Kyaigan region. They are strongly associated with worshippers of [Futami-Shou](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/primal%20spirits/shinri/futamishou.html), [spirit](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/primal%20spirits/shinri) of memories, since they are often used in their rituals. It is said that these vials hold the memories of others and they can be accesed through ancient rituals, but due to their high rate of failure it is believed these are only rumors. Nevertheless the followers of Futami-Shou firmly believe in their abilities and to this day their use remains limited to their region.

# Properties

## Creation

Sakijome vials are made of Cerulean Glass, an extremely resistant and rare compound made from common glass and chi crystals capable of withstanding even steel blows. The exact technique they use remains a guarded secret and today only a few artisans are capable of producing them, making them extremely rare and exclusive. When asked about this they claim even they don't know the specifics, claiming their patron spirit locks their memories of this art and only reveals them when it wishes them to create a new flask. Once finished the vials are then filled with seawater from the Kyaigan region which is rumored to be blessed by Futami-Shou. 

## Abilities

The only known ability these vials posess is their power to retain certain memories of a specific individual, who will forget they ever happened until they open the vial once more. The specific ritual to seal memories is only known by the cult of Futami-Shou and they use it on many of their inductees to remove traumatic or compromising memories from their minds, freeing them from the burden of the past. An unfortunate downside is that the memories can seemingly only be accesed by the person that they belong to, greatly limiting their use. Nevertheless it is believed that certain individuals or high-ranking members of the cult are capable of seeing and interpreting those memories, but the exact knowledge needed for this remains unknown. For this reason they are generally considered to be inferior to [echostones](https://raldamain.com/en/objects/items/magical/echostone.html) and even though initial research attempts were made during the [Shinri Empire](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/nations/shinri_em.html) they eventually amounted to nothing.
