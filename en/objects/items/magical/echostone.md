Even though it may seem like simple gems, Echostones are a fine piece of ancient technology created by long-forgotten civilizations to store information. Their key feature is their ability to record and replay events around them with exact details, granting its users a window into the distant past. While their historical value is immense, unfortunately they are extremely rare and so far their technology has not been accurately replicated.

# Properties

From what is known about their creation process it seems Echostones are made by engraving special runes inside pure chi crystals using ancient techniques that so far have not been replicated. These runes make the stone capable of storing vast amount of information inside and record events around them, displaying them as very detailed illusory images. 

So far some of the Echostone's properties have been uncovered and such technology was used to create recording devices in the late 41st century. With the start of the Age of Imperialism and the exploration of many new lands more Echostones were discovered, displaying events belonging to the Age of Gods or even before. Many great sages have dedicated their lives to uncovering how they work and it is believed that their secrets may be uncovered sooner tha
