[Temash](../../../ideas/cultures/temash.md) legends say that in the ancient days when they were still uncivilized and savage a great sage showed them they way of [Ancestral Worship](../../../ideas/religious groups/temash ancestral worship.md) and united them into the [First Temash Empire](../../../ideas/nations/tamashkhan_empire.md). The sage bore a great spear made of desert sands named Agha Iryan, which was entrusted to him by the Ancestral Spirits so he could lead the Temash people to greatness. He used the spear's power to shape the sands, creating the [seven holy cities](../../../locations/artificial/holy sites/seven holy cities.md) of the Temash and changing parts of the great desert into a fertile land. But hese glory days are now gone and the legendary spear remains lost to time making some believe it never existed in the first place. Nevertheless, many Temash believe it hides somewhere in the desert, waiting for someone chosen to claim it and lead the Temash people once more.
