Kage to Hitari is a legendary sword from Shinri blessed by both Yamma-Sama, spirit of light and motherhood, and Emma-sama, spirit of darkness and calamity. Because of this strange creation the blade is both a weapon of life and death, capable of healing those it touches or inflicting incurable wounds. Due to this weapon's great power it is said that whoever bears it will be the strongest warrior in all of Shinri, a reputation it rightfully earned since many of the land's greatest legends such as Ryo Tamaekachi, Nejiro Norowa and Shizen Shi are counted among its bearers.
