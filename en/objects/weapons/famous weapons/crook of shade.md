Made of rotting wood infused with living shadows, this sinister staff marks its bearer as the chosen of Shade, lord of the Shadow Realm. The artifact is capable of granting mastery of shadow magic to its bearer and allows them to travel freely between the human and shadow realms, spreading this dark dimension's influence into the lands of the living. The staff's most notorious bearer is the necromancer Oriox, dread lord of Hakrapeu, who used this artifact's power to transform his kingdom into a cursed land ruled by the undead.
