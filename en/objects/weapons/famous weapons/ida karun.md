The pride and shame of the Chothgar people, the legendary blade Ida Karun was forged and wielded by their prophet Meisodh and became a powerful symbol of their faith. Rumored to be unbreakable and capable of slicing through anything, this weapon is believed to be one of the most powerful swords in existence matched only by Edge of Justice and Dramako Kinara. While the blade is one of the holiest artifacts of the Chothgar people, it was stolen from them long ago by the [Arshalani empire](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/nations/arshalan.html) after their prophet's death and remains in their hands to this day, thus filling the Chothgar with shame and humiliation.

# History

In the land of Kimon tradition says that a mineral's strength and durability is determined by how dark it is, with the blackest ores having a reputation for being nearly unbreakable. Because of this Meisodh the Traveler chose the blackest ore of them all to craft his sword Ida Karun, creating a pitch-black blade that absorbs all light. To complete this weapon Chothgar legends say that the Traveler tricked an ancient spirit of earth and metal into getting inside the sword claiming he needed its help to repair a crack. Once the spirit was inside Meisodh finished its work, sealing the ancient creature in it so he could imbue the blade with its powers.

Meisodh used this blade to fight in his mythic duel against the prophet Mekhatim and after both perished the weapon was stolen by Mekhatim's followers. This theft was a devastating blow to the Chothgar tribes as without their lord and sacred symbol they fell once again into barbarism and conflict. Ida Karun was brought before the first Mhayid of Arshalan, who placed it at his feet to show the supremacy of the Celestial Host over all its enemies. The blade would remain there for century and would remain a symbol of shame and humiliation for the Chothgar as their sacred relic lay at the feet of their mortal enemies.

When the Chothgar lost their sword the Traveler's followers swore an oath that none of them would ever wield a sword again until their sacred blade was recovered since no blade crafted by their hands could ever match the greatness of Ida Karun. Many Chothgar heroes have tried and failed to recover the blade, but there is still hope that someday it will end in its rightful hands once more and guide the Chothgar towards a new era of greatness. 

# Abilities

Ida Karun fully lives to its reputation of being unbreakable, being capable of slicing rocks and remaining immutable to any attempts to shatter it. This blade can cut through armor and lesser blades with ease and its bearer also gains the ability to manipulate the earth and metals thanks to the influence of the spirit trapped inside.

To use this weapon legends say that its bearer must overcome a trial set by the spirit it holds which consists of defeating such being in a duel. Only once the spirit is beaten the bearer can rightfully bear the blade but if the challenger fails their soul will be trapped inside the blade, joining the spirit in its prison. While many powerful Arshalani warriors have attempted this trial none has succeeded, leading many to believe only those who follow the Traveler can even succeed in the trial.
