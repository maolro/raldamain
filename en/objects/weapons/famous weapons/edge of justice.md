The legendary blade of the prophet [Mekhatim](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20triumph/mekhatim.html), it is said that Edge of Justice fell from Heaven itself as a gift from the angel Ithanatron to the prophet so she could triumph over all foes of the [Celestial Host](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/celestial%20host/). With the sword in hand Mekhatim was victorious in all her battles, conquering vast lands and converting their inhabitants to the Celestial Host. The blade met its equal when Mekhatim fought [Meisodh](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20triumph/meisodh.html) the Traveler in a legendary duel that ended in the death of both combatants. Edge of Justice now remains in the hands of the [Arshalani](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/nations/arshalan.html) royal family, passing down through generations as a symbol of the power and might of the prophet.
