A symbol of the Spirit Custodian's authority, this mythical staff has passed down through generations marking its bearer as a great sage and spiritual teacher. This artifact is made of ironwood and imbued with powerful spirit-binding magic, granting its bearer the ability to unleash magical energy with each strike and greatly improve their spirit-binding abilities. It was used by [Kenamaru](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/kenamaru.html) in his battle against the Incarnate's companions and once he fell the staff was claimed by [Edenor](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/edenor.html), one of the victors of the battle. As a close friend to the Incarnate and a powerful mage in his own right he is without a doubt a deserving wielder of this artifact.
