Transformation points (TP) represent the physiological characteristics of a creature that guarantee its survival. With them a player or the master can create fantastic creatures with ease.

When building a creature of a certain level it is possible to replace one rank that the creature would obtain by 3 PT, which can be spent to obtain improvements. Certain ranks allow spending PT on abilities, which allows a character to alter his own body as long as this remains within the limits of nature (this is dictated by the DM).

This ability grants a fine sense of smell within a 30-foot radius capable of detecting the presence of other creatures in that space (this increases to 60 feet if the winds are favorable and 15 feet if they are not). The sense of smell can also be used to detect the trail of other creatures that have passed through that space, granting you advantage on perception and survival rolls.

Spitting a web costs a standard action and will have a maximum distance of 50 feet. All creatures within 10 feet of the impact radius will be grabbed immediately and must roll strength against your CON to escape. Alternatively, this enhancement can be used as a full turn action to fill a side space equal to three times the size of the creature with webbing, thus making it superior difficult terrain. A creature with this ability cannot be grabbed by spider webs and will suffer no penalty when moving through them.

**Displacement:** Because of temporary magic influences the creature is able to appear and disappear periodically, causing it to avoid direct attacks made against it. A total of three times per combat a creature with this enhancement can evade a direct attack made against it, completely nullifying all the results of the roll (this includes the disadvantages generated by the defender). This ability cannot be used in an antimagic field and if the attacker has the Displacement ability he can spend 1 chi so that the attack is not cancelled.

## Vulnerabilities

Sensitivity to light (-1 TP): The creature's senses are hypersensitive to light, causing them to be oversaturated by high luminosities. When a creature is in a luminous place it will add a disadvantage die to all its attack rolls and attackers will receive an advantage die against it. In case it is affected by a very bright light it will be blinded until it spends one round outside the illuminated space.

Undersize (-3 TP): Decreases the size of the creature by one step, reaching a minimum of tiny. An undersized creature will reduce its FUE and CON by 2 (minimum -2) and increase its DES by 1. Smaller creatures will receive an additional difficulty die on dodge rolls for each size level by which the attacker exceeds the defender.

Blindness (-2 TP): The creature is completely blind, causing it to have to employ a sense other than sight to perceive its surroundings. A creature with this vulnerability is immune to all effects that require sight, but will not be able to make ranged attacks or read written documents. If it has another sense, such as Georradar or Echolocation, the creature will receive no blindness penalty unless its sense is disabled in some way.

Vulnerability to energy (-1 TP): A type of energy is particularly effective against the creature, causing it to inflict lethal damage instead of non-lethal and increasing its base damage by 2. If the creature then gains resistance against this energy it will lose this weakness but will not gain any benefit from it.

Weak spot (-3 TP): The creature has a noticeable weak spot in its solid armor, which if hit will cause lethal wounds. Any attack made against the weak point will add three difficulty dice to the attack roll (two if the attacker has the Aimed Attacks skill), but if the weak point is hit the creature's defense and resistances will not apply against the damage suffered. In addition, if the attacker uses the skill Deadly Aim the damage inflicted will be multiplied by 2.
