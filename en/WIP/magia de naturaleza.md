Add your rank to attacks made with nature magic

<u>Entangling tendril</u>: As a standard action you can attack an enemy up to 60 feet away with a whip of tendrils. On hit with this attack you can grab a part of your target's body, making them entangled and impeding them from moving more than 15 feet from a location of your choice within 60 feet. Your tendrils will be automatically destroyed when they suffer a slashing or fire attack.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. This ability can be used to make an elemental attack affect a 10-foot area or do an additional elemental attack per turn. At rank II this ability can be used make a 15-foot area become difficult terrain. Elemental overflow can only be used once per turn.

<u>Wood shape</u>: As a standard action you can alter the composition of an object made of wood with a maximum size of 5 cubic feet. The altered object can be used as a weapon, which will inflict 1d6 + WIS slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage on hit and has can be thrown to a distance of up to 30 feet. At ranks III and V the size of objects you can alter with this ability increases by 5 feet.

<u>Elemental parry</u>: You are capable of using your element to defend yourself from attacks, which is known as an elemental parry. You can only protect yourself with this ability from elemental, magic or ranged attacks (at rank III this ability can be used to defend yourself against melee attacks).

## Rank II

<u>Plant Growth</u>: As a full-round action employable once per day you can increase the size of plants within 100 feet, turning the entire area into difficult terrain. While you remain in an area affected by plant growth you will gain advantage in all attacks made with elemental magic and doing an elemental attack will cost you a move action. If you affect a crop field with this ability its annual production will increase. 

<u>Wall of thorns</u>: As a standard action you can form a wall made of sharp thorns 15 x rank feet long and 5 x rank feet high. The wall grants full cover to creatures behind it from projectiles and magical attacks, and anyone who attempts to pass through the wall of fire must succeed in an acrobatics check or it will suffer 1 + WIS piercing damage and bleed (on success it will half damage). The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you try to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the beginning of your turn if you keep both walls active. Each 10 ft square section of the wall has HP equal to 4 + rank and 6 DEF and it is vulnerable to slashing and fire damage. A wall of thorns can be created as a reaction once per round in an area affected by plant growth.

## Rank III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20

<u>Animate plants</u>: As a full-round action you can infuse plants with life in a 70-foot area. This ability will only affect areas that have a large volume of plants (i.e., places where plants cause difficult terrain). Whenever a hostile creature passes through an area infested by animated plants it must suceed in a DEX check or become entangled by them. Creatures entangled in this way will also suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the end of their turn. This ability will remain active for an hour and can only be used once per day. 

<u>Control nature</u>: Animals, plants and spirits are not naturally hostile towards you and assist you when you are in danger. When you are in a natural environment that is your favored terrain or your harmonized region you can call upon a number of natural allies as a standard action employable once per day. These allies can be any number of creatures whose combined level equals your rank x 3. An individual creature cannot have a higher level than your own-

<u>Diminish plants</u>: You are able to reverse the growth of plants to maintain natural balance. As a standard action you can reduce the size of plants by 5 x rank cubic feet, eliminating all difficult terrain they form. This ability can also be used to remove nature magic effects such as Wall of thorns, but for this you must succeed on a nature magic check against the effect's creator

## Rank IV

<u>Summon Guardian</u>: A creature from the natural world acts as your guardian, protecting you even when you are away from home. Your guardian is a spirit, plant or animal creature with level equal to your rank x 3. The guardian will be loyal to you as long as you maintain your bond with nature and in case it dies you must spend a month in communing with nature to gain a new one.

<u>Naturalize</u>: Whenever you grab a creature with entangle you can naturalize the non-magical artificial objects it carries. At the end of the round a creature grabbed by entangle will have the effectiveness of the armor and items it is wearing reduced by 1 (effectiveness is a value that indicates the usefulness of an item or armor, equaling a value equal to defense in the case of armor and base damage in the case of weapons). When the effectiveness of the object in question reaches 0 it will be completely destroyed.

<u>Ironwood</u>: Your attacks with alter wood inflict +2 base damage and increase your defense by 2 if you are not wearing metal armor. Creatures grappled by Entangle will increase the level of a permanent wound on a location on their body by one step at the end of each round.

Nature's fury does 5 + success physical damage and with it you can spend 2 perks to grab a target. You can affect up to 60 feet flying creatures, which will [fall](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/reglas%20de%20combate.html#ca%C3%ADdas) to the ground after being grappled.
