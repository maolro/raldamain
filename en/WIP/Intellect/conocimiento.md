## Rank I

You receive an additional talent level in memory.

<u>Loremaster:</u> You have a great diversity of knowledge and a facility for learning new ideas. You receive automatic success on rolls to recall basic concepts of a branch of knowledge and notice immediately if something is out of place. A number of times per day equal to your knowledge rank you can discover a piece of hidden or strange information. The master chooses which information.

<u>Linguist:</u> Learn an additional language fluently. You can communicate in a basic way using languages similar to your own, such as if you speak Ustilese you can communicate in a basic way with someone who speaks Kratese. In range you learn an additional language.

<u>Fast learning:</u> You can improve your mental and physical attributes with adequate study time. If you spend your downtime studying, after one month you permanently increase one of your stats by 1. That stat cannot exceed your intelligence stat and you can only use this ability again when you increase your INT stat.

## Rank II

<u>Arcane Knowledge</u>: By studying ancient tomes or delving into your magical abilities you learn a new unknown spell. You may use a new spell of your own creation, but its strength must be equal to a Rank I spell. Check with the master to see if this is allowed. If you already have spells, you may modify one you already possess.

<u>Magic item user:</u> You are able to identify the properties of a magic item without having to roll. As a move action, you can drain chi from a magic item, granting you an Advantage die on your next spell roll. The item you drain will lose a charge and add one Disadvantage die to all rolls related to it until you take a long rest.

## Rank III 

Create a new Arcane Knowledge spell with strength equivalent to a Rank II spell.

<u>Ritualist:</u> You are able to perform rituals without suffering side effects (you still suffer them if you are interrupted). A ritual is a spell that requires at least 6 rounds of concentration and several rare material components. You can create your own rituals, but you must first consult with the master if you are allowed to do so.

<u>True Knowledge:</u> Once per day, you may cast one of the following effects: 

- Identify all spells, magical properties, and magic ranges of all creatures within 30 feet.
- Knows all the stories and legends of a place, person, or event. To use this ability you must spend one minute concentrating.
