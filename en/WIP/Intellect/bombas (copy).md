Rank I
Add your rank in bombs to all attacks you make.
Bomb making: You know how to make explosives using rudimentary materials. A number of times per day equal to your Rank you can make a bomb, with a maximum of INT + 2 bombs ready. Making a bomb attack is a standard action and will affect all creatures within a 5-foot impact radius. You can combine two bombs to form an even more destructive bomb, which will increase its radius of impact by 5 feet and its base damage by 1. 

- Incendiary Bomb: The bomb does 3+Success fire damage. You can spend 2 generated perks to cause a light burn (4 to inflict a medium burn).
- Acid flask: The bomb does 2+Success acid damage. You can spend 2 perks generated to reduce a target's DEF by 1 or cause a mild burn (4 to inflict a medium burn).
- Fragmentation grenade: The bomb does 3+Success physical damage. You can spend 2 generated perks to cause a light permanent wound to a target (4 to inflict a medium permanent wound). Permanent wounds caused by a grenade increase its level by 1 against lightly armored or unarmored creatures.
- Flashing grenade: The bomb blinds all creatures in the radius for a number of turns equal to the generated hits. You can spend 2 generated perks to stun a target in the area of impact.
- Catchy Grenade: The bomb entangles all creatures that fail the dodge roll. You can spend 2 generated perks to make the target be stuck to a surface, unable to move or dodge.
- Cryogenic Grenade: The bomb releases an extremely cold gas on impact, dealing 3+Cold damage. It will freeze all water in its impact zone and can be used to counter a water elemental attack. You can spend 2 generated perks to slow a target (4 perks to paralyze it).
- Smoke Bomb: The bomb fills a 15-foot radius in the impact zone with smoke, which grants superior concealment to all creatures in its area.

The disadvantages you generate on a bomb attack shot cause you to hit less accurately, causing the bomb to hit a random point located at a distance of 5 feet per disadvantage generated to the targeted location.
Expert Engineer: You are able to automatically identify the properties of a mechanical device without the need for a shot. You can use your intelligence stat on sleight-of-hand shots to pick locks or disable traps. In addition, you can make mechanical traps of your own creation using one hour of work, and you can have a number of traps per day equal to your rank. The effects of the traps are varied and you choose their exact properties, but the attack roll will always be equal to your bomb attack dice. Some examples of traps are as follows:
- Bear Trap: This trap causes a light permanent wound to the creature that steps on it and will keep its leg caught in it, inflicting 1 non-lethal damage each turn it remains trapped.
- Mine Trap: The trap will ignite one of your bombs when triggered. Making a mine trap expends one of your bombs.
- Weapon Trap: The trap will throw a projectile at the creature that activates it, which does 1+Success piercing damage. You can spend 2 generated perks to inflict a light permanent wound (4 perks for a heavy permanent wound).
