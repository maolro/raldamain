|      | Cosmagus crafts Dyvesles Sargatai with Yinamu's advice       |
|      | Yinamu uses Cosmagus' artifact to slay Antaka and seal his essence. The god's death leaves the underworld unattended and the monsters inside it begin to break free. |
|      | The gates of the underworld burst open, starting a great war between humanity and the creatures of the underworld. |
|      | The gates are sealed shut once again by an alliance of gods and mortal heroes. |
|      | A dispute between Aisha and Tanios over who will become the new ruler of the underworld triggers a great dispute between the gods. They divide into two opposing blocs. |
|      | The division among the gods leads to a conflict between Krosos and Eutheria, the two most powerful divine cities. Yinamu joins forces with Aisha while Arume joins forces with Tanios. |
|      | Wesla joins Aisha's faction after the Krosans destroy her sacred groves |
|      | Nanami joins Tanios' faction fearing that Aisha's side is growing too powerful. |
|      | A great tsunami sent by Nanami causes great damage to the city of Eutheria and destroys its fleet. Syd loses nearly everything in this disaster. |
|      | Syd unites with her brother and Rabius to form the Godslayers |
|      | Wesla is killed in secret by Yinamu during a great battle. Arume is blamed for the act and the war continues. |
|      | Vintri joins Aisha's faction and begins inspiring rebel movements inside Krosos. Cosmagus is pressured by Yinamu to do the same in Eutheria to balance both sides. |
|      | Theone finds out the truth about the war and confronts Cosmagus. He breaks down and confesses everything, abandoning Yinamu's side |
|      | Cosmagus crafts Dramako Kinara, the godslayer blade          |
|      | Arume begins crafting a weapon capable of turning gods into mortals. |
|      | Nanami finds out about the weapon and through guile she steals it from Arume and uses it against the god, turning him into a mortal. He is then imprisoned in the goddess' undersea palace. |
|      | Theone sends visions to the Godslayers to rescue Arume from his imprisonment. To aid them Cosmagus gives Dramako Kinara to Syd. |
|      | Syd and the Godslayers kill Nanami and rescue Arume from imprisonment. Theone refuses to return Arume's divine powers, forcing him to remain mortal as a lesson of humility. |
|      | Yinamu blames the Godslayers for the killings of all gods. The gods cease fighting and unite to eliminate the Godslayers. |
|      | Vintri is instructed by the gods to infiltrate the Godslayers, but he ends up becoming friendly with them. |
|      | Syd and Rabius begin a relationship                          |
|      | The Godslayers stage a rebellion against the rulers of Krosos. |
|      | Vintri is found out as a traitor and killed by Tanios. Syd drains his essence before he dies with the sword. |
|      | Syd and the Godslayers infiltrate Tanios' domain and fight him. Rabius kills his father but dies of his wounds. |
|      | Krosos collapses after their god's death. Eutheria is now the dominant power. |
|      | Aisha becomes tyrannical and arrogant due to Yinamu's influence. Eutheria begins to conquer all of Strakia. |
|      | The Godslayers fight against Aisha and Yinamu to free humanity from their tyranny. They are aided in battle by Cosmagus. |
|      | Yinamu drains Aisha's essence before she dies and becomes nearly all-powerful. Cosmagus sacrifices himself to make the god of knowledge lose control of her powers. |
|      | Syd gains the Infinite Cube as a parting gift from Cosmagus. |
|      | Yinamu travells to Ayanuu's lair in a desperate attempt to stop the abyssal from waking again. He is easily overpowered because of a curse Ayanuu planted in him long ago and the chaos god wakes again. |
|      | Syd gathers Dyvesles Sargatai from Yinamu's body             |
|      | Ayanuu's awakening causes many natural disasters and opens the Abyssal rift. Theone sends the Godslayers to contain the rift and stop it from destroying the world. |
|      | Arume regains his divine powers to help in the fight. The Godslayers fight against hordes of Abyssals led by Gulmaht, a primal entity of chaos awakened by Ayanuu. |
|      | Gulmaht is sealed once more in the depths of the earth at the cost of Syd's life. |
|      | Theone sacrifices her essence to create the Seal of Harmony, trapping Ayanuu in the planet and ensuring no being can gain divine power ever again in the world. |
|      | Arume is named guardian of Humanity by Theone as the last remaining god. He takes a new name, a name that will make him be remembered forever: [Feyn](../creatures/superior beings/feyn.md). |
