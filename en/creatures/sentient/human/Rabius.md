# **Rabius and Alexander Backstory**

Rabius and Alexander were two sons of Tanios and a mortal but began their lives in completely separate environments. While Alexander's mother was a high priestess and his birth was seen as a blessing for the people of Krosos, Rabius was the son of a prostitute and from the beginning was cursed to a life of hardship. While Rabius was growing up his mother told him stories of his father the great god Tanios, but he didn't believe that since he thought if his father really was a god he would do something to improve his life. Alexander, on the other hand, was raised as a noble and told from an early age that he was destined for greatness. Rabius manifested his magical powers accidentally after a moment of strong emotion, but these only made the people around him fear and despise him. Nevertheless, Rabius believed this was a sign that her mother's stories were true and trained hard to fulfill his destiny. Meanwhile, Alexander was taught by the high priests of Tanios how to control his powers. The lives of both half-brothers would collide when both of them entered the Ishadan Games to gain the coveted prize of a position in Krosos' great council. Alexander was pushed by the high priests to participate so he could ascend in power and become more popular while Rabius participated with the hopes of becoming recognized by the people of his city as a great hero. Rabius and Alexander fought in the final match but their clash ended in a draw. The high priests then declared Alexander as a winner, filling Rabius with rage at such an unjust decision. In his eyes, he had lost his opportunity to achieve his dreams and the anger at losing to a worthless noble made him lose control of his powers and attack everyone near him. Rabius' wrath caused Tanios to intervene and stop his rampage. The god of the skies gave Rabius one last chance to repent but his son confronted him, asking to know why he had abandoned him and let him suffer for so long. Furious at his son's hubris, Tanios exiled him and gave him a curse that would make him enter a rage and lose control of his body whenever he felt strong emotions
