title: Chothgar
---

The mere mention of the Chothgar strikes terror in peoples across the Continent. Very few have bothered to study Chothgar culture, but those who have found that this seemingly uncivilized race hides many more secrets beneath its surface, particularly their strong sense of honor on the battlefield and their fervent devotion to their ancient hero known as [Meisodh the Traveler](../../../../characters/age of triumph/meisodh.md). Some Chothgar have chosen to abandon the traditional path of their people, converting to the [Mekhatimite](../../../../ideas/religious groups/mekhatimism.md) faith and joining the [Arshalani Empire](../../../../ideas/nations/arshalan.md). These Chothgar, known as Shetyen, are some of the most ardent followers of their faith and many go on to become holy warriors of Arshalan.
