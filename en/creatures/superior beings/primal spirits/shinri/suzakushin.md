title: Suzakushin
---

Suzakushin is the Shinri spirit of fire and the patron of the [Hibotoru clan](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/factions/hibotoruclan.html). Depicted as a raging phoenix, Suzakushin is known for his short temper and destructive tendencies just as the element he represents. At the same time he is considered a spirit of rebirth as the fires he causes give the land a chance to renew and act as a fundamental part of the cycle of life. Suzakushin is also well known for his rivalry with the northern spirit [Seiryuu](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/primal%20spirits/shinri/seiryuu.html) and both of them have fought in numerous occasions, a conflict that also reflects the enmity between their chosen clans.
