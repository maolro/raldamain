Wants: Peace among humans and gods and rid the world of violence. 

Needs: See the good of humanity and accept that her single-minded pursuit of peace will lead to war.

Flaw: When she was young she used to be na√Øve and quick to assumptions, but after witnessing the cruelty of humans her ideals changed profoundly. Now she believes that humans are innately violent and any method is justified in the pursuit of her goals, even using force to achieve peace.
