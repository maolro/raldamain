The Celestial Host are an order of superior entities dedicated to preserving life in the universe and guiding it towards enlightenment. Wise beyond human understanding and more powerful than Raldamain's strongest gods, the Host prefers to watch and influence mortal beings in subtle ways to ensure they do not stray from the righteous path. Along with the Infernals and the Abyssals the Host is one of the three groups of outer entities that seek to influence and control Raldamain.

# Origin

Occultist writings claim that the members of the Celestial Host were once mortals who discovered deep universal truths that gave them immense magical power and ascended them to divinity. The Mekhatimist faith fiercely denies this, claiming instead that the first members of the Celestial Host were born from the Cosmic Fire, source of all life in the universe. No matter their origin the Host always had a desire to protect and guide life, seeding many worlds with primitive life forms and terraforming planets to ensure the development of sapient beings. The followers of the Host claim that all life in Raldamain originates from these entities and they are the true gods of the world.

The Host's desire for life faced a great test with the awakening of the Dark Storm, fated destroyer of the universe and part of its eternal cycle. To stop the end of all existence the Celestials went on a nearly-suicidal quest into the Akhasic Record, preserver and repository of all universal knowledge, to find a way they could seal the Storm. Most of those who went on this quest ended up lost to time, but the survivors managed to return with knowledge of a ritual capable of sealing the Storm itself. With this knowledge the Host fought a great battle for the fate of the universe against the Storm and its wicked spawn, successfully sealing it away and saving all of life from destruction. The Celestials also sealed away the Storm's monstrous children, known as the Lords of Chaos, in many faraway realms and dimensions to ensure they could never threaten existence again.
