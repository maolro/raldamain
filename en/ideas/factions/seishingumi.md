title: Seishin-Gumi
---

The Seishin-Gumi was a secret organization of spirit-hunters whose goal was to protect the Shinri people from threats both from the spirit and material planes. Formed by one of the [First Incarnate's](../../characters/age of succesion/firstincarnate.md) companions, the Seishin-Gumi began to amass great power as time went on to the point that during the Age of Warlords they ruled the city of [Homay](../../locations/artificial/settlements/cities/homay.md) from the shadows and were powerful enough to manipulate the fate of entire clans. The organization lost most of their influence after their defeat in the war of Two Incarnates and  officially replaced by the Guardians of Harmony as the main protectors of Shinri, the new organization still preserved most of the old members and command structure the Seishin-Gumi once had. While their task was considered noble and fundamental to protect Shinri from dark spirits and chaos by its members, those opposed to the Seishin-Gumi saw them as power-hungry fanatics who were exploiting the spirits for their personal gain.
