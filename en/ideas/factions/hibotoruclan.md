title: Hibotoru clan
---

The Hibotoru clan is a powerful Shinri noble family who traditionally had great influence over the Shinri government and were the land's strongest feudal lords during the Age of Warlords. Their influence dates back to the beginning of Shinri itself as their ancestors were among the first Drakutian settlers to colonize the region. The clan's patron is the phoenix spirit [Suzakushin](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/primal%20spirits/shinri/suzakushin.html) and thanks to a pact the clan's patriarch made with him long ago they are capable of channeling the power of elemental fire. Just like fire the Hibotoru are well-known for being energetic and determined along with falling easily into rage and strong emotions.
