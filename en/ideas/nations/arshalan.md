title: Arshalani empire
---

The Arshalani empire is a great power located in the subcontinent of [Kimon](https://raldamain.com/en/locations/continents/kimon.html) which encompasses a wide variety of lands and peoples. Founded by the prophet [Mekhatim](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20triumph/mekhatim.html) herself and ruled by the descendants of her first converts, Arshalan is the global capital of her faith and its reason for existence is to spread her holy message across the world. Its religious zeal has made it many enemies such as [Mazarin](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/nations/mazarin.html), [Ustilus](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/nations/ustilus.html) and the [Chothgar](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/nations/chothgar.html) horde, who have fought great wars with Arshalan throughout the nation's history. Nevertheless, the Arshalani people believe that as long as they remain faithful to the Prophet's words they can face any threat and keep moving forwards until they achieve their divine mission.
