The epic tale of the rise and fall of the First empire of Humanity echoes across the many peoples of [Raldamain](https://raldamain.com/en/locations/continents/raldamain.html) as an both a testament to the greatness the human race can achieve and a cautionary tale warning about the consequences of challenging a god. For its long duration the First Empire was the chosen state of [Feyn](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/feyn.html) the god of Humanity and under his guidance they built architectural wonders such as flying cities and brought the light of civilization to the primitive peoples of Raldamain. This greatness would end up corrupting the empire's rulers who began to grow prideful and envious of Feyn himself, culminating in its [last emperor](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20humanity/tenebrius.html) leading a rebellion against Feyn in an attempt to usurp his throne. For his hubris the god's wrath destroyed everything the empire ever built, throwing the continent into a prolonged dark age. While the empire is now gone its impact on the culture, faith, laws and technology of Raldamain is immeasurable and would form the cornerstone of future civilizations for millennia to come.
