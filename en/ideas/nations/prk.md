title: People's republic of Klonum
---

The People's Republic of Klonum was an unrecognized short-lived state proclaimed by Crimson revolutionaries from the city of Klonum in the year 4100. Born out of the chaos of a popular revolt against a corrupt leader, the People's republic was formed by a radical group of rebels who wanted to create a new country where the Shinri people would be united, equal and free from traditions that were holding them back. From the very beginning the People's republic was plagued by infighting and violent purges against supposed counterrevolutionaries where even its initial supporters were targeted. After six years of fighting against the remnants of the Shinri alliance it was eventually eliminated after the recapture of Klonum which led to the death or exile of its leadership.
