The Shinri empire is a nation in [Raldamain](../../locations/continents/raldamain.md) which grew to become a colonial superpower after its victory in the Mazarin war. Once known as the [Shinri alliance](shinri_alliance.md), its land rapidly changed from one ruled by feuding warlords to a modern and industrialized nation state with global ambitions throughout the 41st century. Shinri identity was once defined by the worship of the [spirits of nature](../../creatures/superior beings/primal spirits/shinri.md), and even though this faith is in decline due to the transformation from a rural to an urban society it still remains one of the pillars of Shinri culture. Respect for the spirits is one of the factors behind the Shinri empire's global expansion as they seek to find new natural resources to extract since overexploiting their own resources would mean angering the spirits of nature.
