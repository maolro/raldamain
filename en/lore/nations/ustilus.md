"Ustilus represents the hopes and dreams of humanity, a shining beacon of what humans can achieve once they work together. Our nation has spread civilization and progress throughout the continent and beyond, bringing millions under the banner of Feyn and vastly improving their standard of living. But, at the same time, our name is also associated with violence and conquest, and we must not forget that many of the people who we rule see us not as benevolent overlords but as brutal tyrants. If we will move forward, even in these troubled times, we must remember what made Ustilus great and right the wrongs of our past. Because if we remain blind any longer and refuse to face reality we will face an inevitable collapse and once we fall history will judge us harshly." 

â€‹	-Ileria, prime minister of Ustilus under the Constitutional monarch Theodora

# History

## Origins and imperial settlement (21st -  late 22nd century AF)

Ustilian civilization is a complex and rich history that spans many centuries. It is believed that the Ustilian people were originally a primitive culture that followed pagan religions and worshipped the spirits of the land. Their land, known as the Ustal, was home to small settlements where agriculture was practiced.

In the later years of the First Empire, colonists arrived in the Ustal and introduced the Feynist religion to the native people. However, these colonies were short-lived as the Tangarin hordes invaded the region, causing destruction and chaos. In response, the First Empire sent a military expedition to defeat the Tangarin and established several military bases along the way.

After successfully defeating the Tangarin, the First Empire soldiers settled in the Ustal and the military bases expanded into small cities. These cities eventually came together to form the vassal-state of Elyon, named after the capital city. When the First Empire fell, Elyon became an independent territory, one of the last remnants of the First Empire which preserved of many of its traditions.

Throughout its history, Ustilian civilization has been shaped by a variety of cultural and political influences. It is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of its people, who have managed to thrive and preserve their way of life in the face of numerous challenges and changes.

## The two feynist kingdoms (2209 - 2639)

The founding and unification of the Feynist kingdoms of Deverent and Elyon marked an important moment in the history of the Ustal lands. It was during this time that the kingdom of Mazarin, the continent's new great power, began to colonize the northern coasts of the Ustal lands and spread the Feynist religion.

An exiled Mazarine prince named Kelsar arrived on the northern coasts of Ustilus and formed an independent Feynist kingdom named Deverent. Meanwhile, the kingdom of Elyon, which had been established by the First Empire, began to spread inland. When the two kingdoms met they fought for supremacy over the Ustal lands in a war that would span several decades.

According to legend, King Althar of Deverent and Queen Sarani of Elyon fought each other in a duel for many days, each claiming to be the true chosen of Feyn. The duel ended in a draw and both rulers recognized each other as equally chosen by Feyn, ultimately leading to the unification of their kingdoms through marriage. It is said that they placed the first stone of a city that would later become the imperial capital of Feyn's Throne, symbolizing the unity of the two kingdoms.

The founding and unification of Deverent and Elyon played a significant role in shaping the history and culture of the Ustal lands. It marked the beginning of a new era of prosperity and peace, as the two kingdoms came together to form a strong and unified nation.

## The first Ustilian kingdom (2639 - 3324)

The history of the kingdom of Ustilus is a long and tumultuous one, marked by periods of great prosperity and achievement as well as times of conflict and unrest. The formation of the first kingdom of Ustilus, through the union of Deverent and Elyon, marked the beginning of a golden age under the rule of King Arimion the Great.

During this time, Ustilus became one of the largest and most prosperous kingdoms in Raldamain, expanding its borders and its faith to encompass the entire Ustal lands. Under the reign of Arimion's son, Pelagar, the kingdom launched a campaign to eradicate the influence of pagan cults in the region, leading to the formation of the Church of Feyn as the highest religious authority. During this campaign many of the land's most powerful spirits were slain through divine rituals.

However, tensions with the kingdom of Mazarin arose when the Mazarine monarch claimed to be the only true chosen of Feyn, leading to centuries of tension between the two kingdoms. The golden age of Ustilus came to an abrupt end when the empire of Tamashkhan rose to power in the south and conquered the southern Ustilian province of Pradjadi, leading to a devastating war.

The city of Feyn's Throne, the capital of Ustilus, withstood a prolonged siege by Tamashkhan forces, but the kingdom was eventually soundly defeated by King Vardel, who was known as the Hammer of the Tamash. In response, Vardel formed the Knights of Ustilus, an order of holy warriors, to protect the kingdom against future threats.

The Temash invasion of the Citadel also provoked the rage of other Feynist kingdoms, who sent armies of holy warriors to assist Ustilus. While the Tamash were driven back to Pradjati, Ustilus was thrown into a century of holy war as it sought to recover all of its lands. During this time, tensions arose between the Knights of Ustilus and the Church of Feyn, which was seen as decadent and power-hungry by the knights. After a group of disgruntled mazarine soldiers raided Feyn's Throne and sacked its outer walls there was great popular discontent against the monarchy and the church for their weakness, and many believed that Feyn himself had abandoned the kingdom.

This unrest eventually led to a rebellion led by a group of heretic knights, who claimed that the rulers had committed grave sins and that the kingdom's problems were due to divine punishment. The rebellion spread rapidly, defeating many feudal lords and consolidating vast swaths of land under the banner of the Kingdom of Feyn. However, it was later revealed that the leading knights of the rebellion were secretly worshipping the dark god Sek-Tebos, leading to the rebellion's defeat. While the leaders were executed, many of the rebellion's supporters fled westwards and spread their religion to a faraway continent.

The civil war that ensued devastated the kingdom of Ustilus and left it weakened, leading to an era of warring feudal lords. This period of chaos was further exacerbated by the expansionist policies of the Tamashkhan and Mazarin empires, which began to conquer Ustilian lands.

The Ustilian kingdom finally collapsed with the arrival of an invading army from beyond the western sea, which easily defeated the Ustilians thanks to their superior technology and secret assistance from Sek-Tebos. The Ustilian lands were subsequently subjected to the Rakashite Empire, which would go on to rule the region for centuries. Despite this, the Ustilian people have managed to preserve their culture and traditions, continuing to play an important role in the history of Raldamain.

## The Infernal Empire (3324 - 3496)

The Rakashite occupation of Ustilus was a dark and tumultuous period in the history of the Ustilian people. The Rakashite forces easily overpowered the Ustilians and, after a nearly year-long siege, the city of Feyn's Throne fell to the invaders due to traitors within the walls. The great city was razed and a new capital, named Sek-Tessos, was built in its place.

During the occupation, the Rakashites destroyed much of the ancient Ustilian culture and wiped out most of the Knights of Ustilus. The survivors fled to the Vorai islands, where they formed a new Feynist kingdom independent free from their conquerors. While the Rakashites caused great destruction, they also contributed significantly to the development of Ustilus, creating an efficient system of roads and modernizing the Ustilian army with their gunpowder technology.

The conquest of Ustilus by the Rakashites also led to tensions with the neighboring kingdom of Mazarin. The Mazarines attempted to lead a holy war against the Rakashites, but their efforts failed due to the distrust between the Mazarines and Ustilians. However, the Mazarines were able to conquer the Ustilian province of Kratoi and established a puppet Ustilian kingdom there.

The Rakashite Empire eventually fell into a prolonged civil war over succession upon the death of its godlike emperor in the year 3460, which lasted for nearly forty years. During this time, a great Feynist rebellion led by an Ustilian general named Akrodios successfully took control of the capital city of Sek-Tessos and renamed it Feyn's Throne once again. This was seen by many as a sign of Feyn's blessing, and after a long and arduous struggle, the remaining Rakashites were defeated and Ustilus rose once again as an independent kingdom.

The Rakashite occupation of Ustilus was a difficult and trying time for the Ustilian people, but it ultimately led to their eventual triumph over their oppressors and the restoration of their kingdom.

## The Ustilian Empire (3496 - 4000)

After regaining their freedom from the Rakashites king Akrodios set out to reunify the former Ustilian lands, a campaign that would last for the remainder of his lifetime. Even though he was unsuccessful in achieving his dream, during his reign the church of Feyn rose to its former power and the Knights of Ustilus were reinstated as holy warriors in service of the emperor. The knights would wage a prolonged campaign to exterminate all heretics in Ustilus and managed to wipe out most of the cult of Sek-Tebos.

During his final days the emperor began to receive visions from Feyn which revealed to him that Ustilus would become the greatest empire humanity has ever seen and the god himself would return to the world in the fourth millennium after his ascension, leading his people to a new age of glory. These prophecies would serve as a divine mandate for Akrodios' successors and would inspire them to expand even further to unite all of humanity under a single nation. This process began once all of the former ustilian lands were succesfully reunified in the year 3576, achieving the first emperor's  dream.

Under the rule of Emperor Itakamendros I, the Empire of Ustilus expanded north and south, reconquering Pradjati from the Tamash and Kratoi from the Mazarines in two brilliant campaigns. In order to gain the loyalty of the conquered populations, the emperor allowed them to keep their traditions and granted them a small measure of autonomy.

- Dyuring Akrodios' reign the Church of Feyn returned to its former power and the order of the Knights of Ustilus was reformed. The knights fought a prolonged campaign to exterminate all heretics in Ustilus and managed to wipe out most of the cult of Sek-Tebos. The cult's remnants plotted for the next centuries 
- The Ustilian empire expanded towards the north and south, reconquering Pradjati from the Temash and Kratoi from the Mazarines in two brilliant campaigns waged by emperor Itakamendros I. To gain the loyalty of the conquered population the emperor allowed them to keep their traditions and gain a small measure of autonomy,
- Ustilus' ambitions were cut short with the rise of the Arshalani empire in the east and the ascension of king Alden I in Mazarin, an intelligent and ambitious monarch who reformed the mazarine kingdom after the loss of Kratoi and made it into a dangerous foe once more. These three nations would spend the next century competing for supremacy in Raldamain.
- During its expansion Ustilus encountered the Hobgoblin Legion and fought many wars to conquer their lands. In one of these conflicts the Legion managed to reach the capital and was forced to retreat after a prolonged siege.
- In the year 3898 emperor Variager the cruel rose to power. During his reign he finally subjugated the Legion after waging a genocidal campaign against them. The legion lands were split into the province of Thalos and the protectorate of Iskaria in order to weaken legion authority and most of the hobgoblin population was enslaved.
- The new emperor also vastly expanded ustilian lands by conquering the Temash, gaining control over the valuable chi mines of the south. Domestically he ruled as an absolute monarch, purging all nobles opposed to him and centralizing state power in himself. He also favored the Knights of Ustilus and granted them more power and authority, having them act as his religious police.
- Variager was succeeded by his son Lysandros in 3942 after a brief succession war. The new emperor continued his father's policies of expansion and fought wars against Arshalan and the empire of Shiraj for control over the southern continent. 
- Due to the extreme cost of the wars Lysandros was forced to make concessions to the nobility to gain their support, granting them more independence and creating the Ustilian Parliament, a state organ that would advise the emperor and create laws subject to the emperor's approval.
- Lysandros' son Stepanos III went even further, delegating most of his power to the parliament and increasing representation to many of the new regions. During his reign Ustilus established colonies in Shinri and incorporated the elven lands as protectorates.
- With the discovery of the magical properties of chi a new boom in technology and magical development began. The church adamantly opposed arcane magic and many of Ustilus' greatest minds were persecuted and imprisoned. 
- While Stepanos' daughter Theodora was opposed to these policies, the knights had become very powerful since Variager's time and the emperor was too weak to oppose them. She formed a secret organization known as the Pact  which gathered forbidden knowledge and protected dissidents from persecution.

## The death of Feyn and the era of Heresy  (4000 - 4010)

- On the day when Akrodios' prophecy would be fulfilled the great god Feyn suddenly disappeared, throwing the empire in turmoil and severely weakening the power of the church and the knights. Parliament was split between two political factions, the Reformists who wanted change for Ustilus and the Imperialists who wanted to preserve it.
- Mazarin used this chance to try and invade Kratoi but failed miserably thanks to the actions of a legendary military unit known as the Brotherhood of the Crow. While the ustilian army was distracted, the Pact now led by the rogue knight Laicon of Dairov began to organize rebel groups in the Temash and hobgoblin lands.
- Laicon attempted to cause a temash revolt in the lands of Pradjati but he was caught by the Ustilian authorities. His execution at the hands of the knights made him into a martyr and triggered a great revolution which threatened to tear apart the empire.
- In response to the rebellion the knights of Ustilus led by Grand Master Abshalom declared a state of emergency and closed down Parliament, an action described by many prominent nobles as a bloodless coup. As the highest authority of the empire the knights began a massive military campaign to crush all rebel movements. 
- After two years of war the Ustilians managed to defeat the hobgoblin rebels, but victory came at a great economic cost. To maintain control they had no choice but to install a new government formed by hobgoblins allied with Ustilus which to the Imperialists' anger were granted more autonomy and seats in the Parliament.
- During a military expedition to defeat Temash rebels in the south grand master Abshalom perished in battle. Authority passed to Fileon, a popular knight and military hero, who continued the campaign and successfully defeated the Temash.
- Once Fileon became the new grand master he ended the state of emergency and returned power to the Parliament. Not long after the old emperor Stepanos III died of old age and the throne passed to his daughter Theodora, a longtime supporter of the Reformists. The new empress named the Reformist leader Ileria as prime minister
- Fileon changed many of the order's rules such as the prohibition to marry non-humans and made it subordinate to the State instead of the church. To show his commitment to these new ideals he married prime minister Ileria, who was his longtime secret lover.
- With Theodora's support Ileria passed the empire's first Constitution, which granted freedom of religion to Ustilian citizens and ending enslavement of non-humans. It also granted vast autonomy to the regions and led them choose their own representatives for Parliament, which was now the empire's most powerful authority.
- A succession war within Arshalan in 4006 caused a massive flow of refugees into Ustilus. These refugees were forced into slums where they lived in terrible conditions and suffered religious discrimination at the hands of the authorities, since they followed the Celestial Host instead of Feyn.
- The Imperialists saw this as an opportunity to cause tensions with Arshalan to make the Reformist government seem weak and incapable of ruling. In the Imperialist-ruled province of Elyon a massacre unfolded against the Arshalani minority, who were accused of being enemy spies.
- In response to the massacre the Arshalani monarch Chandrial, a military genius and devoted follower of the Celestial Host, declared war on Ustilus using the justification of protecting the Arshalani minorities within Ustilus. He took the city of Elyon in a surprise attack and dealt a powerful blow to the Ustilian government.
- After the fall of Elyon, Ileria resigned after pressure from the army and the war against Arshalan began. The Ustilians   were unprepared and incapable of facing the much stronger Arshalani army, which counted with divine blessings and a brilliant leader at its head. In the end they were pushed back all the way to Feyn's throne where a new siege unfolded.
- While the Arshalani army moved towards the capital Chadrial began to convert many ustilians to his faith, proclaiming that the Celestial Host were the true successors of Feyn. The Temash and the hobgoblins revolted once again, seeing Arshalan as their liberator from Ustilian oppression.
