# **Rabius' Backstory**

Born as a child between Tanios and a prostitute, growing up his mother told him stories of his father the great god Tanios, but he didn't believe that since he thought if his father really was a god he would do something to improve his life. Rabius manifested his magical powers accidentally after a moment of strong emotion, but these only made the people around him fear and despise him. Nevertheless, Rabius believed this was a sign that her mother's stories were true and trained hard to fulfill his destiny.
