Meisodh, known as the Traveler, is a Chothgar warlord and prophet who united the Chothgar people for the first time in history as a great empire and converted nearly all of them to his new religion, the Yathan'ra way. Known as an undefeated warrior and one of the continent's most brilliant and brutal leaders, Meisodh ravaged across the subcontinent of Kimon and challenged the Arshalani empire for hegemony. His most legendary act was his duel with the Arshalani prophet Mekhatim that ended with the death of both combatants, beginning centuries of conflict between the successors of both great leaders. While his empire did not last long after his death the traveler is considered by the Chothgar to be the greatest warrior to ever live and a righteous example to follow.
