The Godswar was a conflict that took place in the elder days of Giinosia fought between the planet's elder gods for control of the world. The war was sparked by the actions of Yinamu, the god of knowledge, who believed that the only way to prevent the impending doom of the world was to sacrifice the divine essences of the other gods. The god of knowledge manipulated his fellow divinities into fighting each other and threw the world into a prolonged period of chaos.

# Background

The conflict can be traced back to a vision that Yinamu received from Ayanuu, the primal entity of chaos. In this vision, Yinamu was warned of the looming disaster and the need for an ancient ritual involving the sacrifice of divine essences. However, when Yinamu tried to warn the other gods of this danger, they did not believe him and treated him as if he had gone insane. This rejection caused Yinamu to become determined to kill the other gods, seeing it as the only way to save the world.

As the first step in his plan, Yinamu manipulated Cosmagus, the god of magic, into creating an artifact known as the Infinite Cube, which was capable of draining divine essence. Yinamu was able to do this by taking advantage of the respect that Cosmagus had for him and his status as an outcast among the gods.

Before the war, there were already tensions between Tanios, the god of the sky, and Aisha, the goddess of the sun. These tensions were due to their conflicting ideals and their competition for control over the mortal world. Yinamu exploited these tensions by sending visions to Tanios, which inflated his ego and made him believe that he was chosen to lead the gods.

In the mortal world, there were two powerful city-states, Eutheria and Krosos, which were radically different in ideology and religion. Eutheria was a city based on reason, ruled by a council of enlightened philosophers, and was blessed by Aisha and Yinamu. Krosos, on the other hand, was a militant city ruled by warmongering religious zealots, and worshipped Tanios and Arume, god of war.

In the midst of this tense climate, Yinamu used the Infinite Cube to kill Antaka, the god of the Underworld, and drain his essence. This action left the Underworld unattended and threw the mortal world into turmoil, leading to the onset of the Godswar.
