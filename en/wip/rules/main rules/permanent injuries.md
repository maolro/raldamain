title: Permanent injuries
---

Permanent injuries are all wounds that cause lasting damage to a person's body. A character will receive a permanent injury whenever it takes hit point damage or suffers a critical hit, which will increase the level of all permanent injuries dealt by one step.

The injury you inflict will affect a random part of the target's body unless you spend take a -2 penalty to target a specific location. If you take a second permanent wound again in a place where you already have one, increase the level of that wound by one step. Permanent injury will have different effects depending on the body part they target, as is specified in the following list:

## Head

To aim at the head a character must take an additional -2 penalty to all attack rolls. If you are hit in the head, make an additional 1d10 roll to determine if you suffer an additional injury to your eyes, ears, or neck. The effects you receive from being hit in one of these parts of the head depends on the type of permanent injury you have suffered.

**Mild:** You are staggered for one turn and receive disadvantage in Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma related skill checks.

**Medium:** Reduce your INT, WIS and CHA stats by 1. You are stunned for one turn and remain staggered until you are healed, in addition to the effects caused by a mild permanent injury. 

**Severe:** Reduce your INT, WIS and CHA stats by 2. You fall unconscious until you take damage or are awakened by another creature. If you take an additional permanent injury to your head you will suffer brain damage, which will kill you in one round unless receive healing. Even if you are healed, you will receive an insanity of the DM's choice.

## Arms

Targeting a specific arm requires you to take an additional -2 penalty on attacks.

**Mild:** You gain disadvantage in all actions in which you use your wounded arm, including attack and defense rolls.

**Medium:** Reduce your STR and DEX by 1 and you are disarmed. Enemies gain advantage in attacks against you if you attempt to parry to defend yourself with a weapon carried by your injured arm.
