title: Talents

Talents represent your proficiency in various abilities not related to skill ranks. Your proficiency with a skill is marked by your talent level, which ranges from 0 to 5. At level 1 you have four talent levels to distribute (at most you can reach 2), and at each subsequent level you receive an additional talent level. Whenever you attempt an ability check in which you have proficiency due to a talent you will add the talent's level to it.

Each talent is associated with a stat, which is indicated in the following list.

## Talent list

### Athletics (STR)

You have proficiency in climbing, swimming, or long-distance running. One of your speeds (swim, climb or base) increases by 5 feet each time you gain a new talent level. This can reach a maximum speed of 45 feet.

### Acrobatics (DEX)

You possess a fine sense of balance and great flexibility. You are proficient in skill ability checks to move across tight surfaces, make acrobatic jumps, and avoid falls. Each level of Acrobatics increases your horizontal jump speed by 5 feet and vertical jump speed by 1 foot.

### Insight (WIS)

You have a sense of intuition that allows you to detect lies. You receive proficiency on ability checks to determine if the person you are interacting with is lying to you. The target must roll Deception if they are lying to you, and if you succeed you will know for certain whether or not they are lying to you. You can also roll insight to defend yourself against feints.

### Wreck (STR)

You are proficient in skill ability checks to break objects or cause damage to structures. Making a wreck ability roll costs you a standard action and on hit you deal damage to the object depending on the weapon you use. An object has defense and HP values depending of its size and materials. If you manage to deal damage to the item it will reduce its efficiency by 1, becoming completely destroyed if its HP is reduced to 0. 

### Deception (CHA)

You are adept at lying in a way that makes it appear as if you are telling the truth. You are proficient in ability checks to lie to other characters in a way it seems you are telling the truth. The GM can grant you advantage or disadvantage on the check depending of the quality of your lies. If a player tries to use Insight to figure out if you are lying, you can communicate your results secretly to the GM so that the other player does not know if you are using Deception or not. Deception can also be used to communicate secret messages to an ally without another character knowing or to feint another character in combat.

### Memory (INT)

You are an expert in fields related to a subject. You are proficient in ability checks to remember or know information related to a specific subject. Each time you gain a talent level you can choose a different subject in which you are proficient. Some topics to choose from are engineering, history, medicine, theology, chemistry and cryptography. You can also choose as a subject to know the traits, history and behaviors of a specific culture or species.

### Heroics (STR)

You are able to use your physical strength to perform great feats on the battlefield. You have proficiency in attack ability checks to perform combat maneuvers (Grapple, Trip, Push or Disarm) and to attack with improvised weapons. You can also use Heroics to defend yourself against combat maneuvers or do an amazing feat of physica strength.

### Intimidate (STR)

You use your strength to demoralize your opponents without the need to make an attack. You have proficiency in ability checks to demoralize opponents or to pressure a creature weaker than you to do favors for you by force. The target will roll defensively with Strength (or Intimidate if you have it) if you seek to demoralize it or Charisma if you seek to pressure it. A creature you pressure will do the favor for you but its attitude will be reduced by one level.

### Sleight of hand (DEX)

You have the proficiency in ability checks to pick locks, steal other people's belongings, or perform simple magic tricks. If you seek to make a sleight of hand ability check against a person watching you they will roll Perception defensively to detect your subterfuge. Using this ability in combat costs you a standard action (full-round action if you attempt to pick a lock).

### First Aid (WIS)

You instinctively know how to stabilize an injured person. As a standard action you can stabilize a creature with 0 or fewer hit points. If you use First Aid on a creature that is already stabilized you can stop the creature's bleeding and heal HP equal to the number of talent levels you have. You can only use First Aid this way in combat a number of times per day equal to your talent level and only once per rest. You do not consume a use of this ability if you have the appropriate healing materials

### Perception (WIS)

Your senses allow you to notice details and alert you to danger. You are proficient at ability checks related to sight, hearing, and smell, and at noticing details in your surroundings. If a creature tries to hide it will resist with its Stealth skill against your Perception. Using Perception to notice details or identify hidden creatures costs you a move action.

### Persuasion (CHA)

You have proficient in ability checks to change people's attitudes on a given subject and to convince them of a given action. The difficulty roll varies according to the opinion of your interlocutors towards you, increasing in difficulty if they are more hostile. Persuasion does not allow you to change the attitude of the people you interact with or to ask them for favors too risky, actions that can be performed with Influence ranks.

### Stealth (DEX)

You are adept at avoiding detection. You are proficient in ability checks to hide and move silently. Hiding is a move action only you can use only if you have some kind of cover or concealment. If you attack a creature which is unaware of your location it will not be able to defend itself. You can move while in stealth without revealing your position by moving at half speed, and whever you do an attack your location will be revealed immediately.

### Survival (WIS)

You are proficient in ability checks to survive in a wild environment or to follow another creature's tracks. The difficulty roll is decided by the master and depends on the danger of the environment and factors related to the creatures you track (for example, the number of creatures and how recent the tracks are). Your Survival levels increase with ranks in Tracking.
