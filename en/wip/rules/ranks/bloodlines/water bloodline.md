## Rank I

You gain resistance 2 to physical damage and you unlock ranks in [water elemental magic](../../../../rules/ranks/elemental magic/water magic.md)

<u>Water adaptation</u>: You receive resistance to cold damage equal to your water bloodline rank. You will also suffer no ill effects from extreme cold and marine animals will not naturally hostile towards you.

<u>Hydrokinesis:</u> You can shape small amounts of water to your will. As a bonus action usable once per turn you can manipulate a small amount of water or alter its current stsate. You can affect water in the following ways:

- Evaporate a quantity of water with a maximum volume of one square foot adjacent to you.
- Move an amount of water of volume equal to one square foot in a direction of your choice. The water you manipulate will not harm or push.

## Rank II

Increase your CON by 1.

<u>Skilled Swimmer:</u> You receive a swim speed of 30 feet. Being underwater does not impair your vision and you automatically succeed on rolls to swim in strong currents (they will still impair your movement). You suffer no non-lethal damage from swimming for an excessive amount of time.

<u>Water breathing</u>: Your lungs are better adapted to breathing underwater. You are able to hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your rank and you cannot be drowned by elemental water magic

<u>Hydraulic push:</u> As a bonus action you can suffer 2 non-lethal damage to infuse your attacks with your element. An infused attack will deal +1 base damage and you will gain advantage in combat maneuvers. If you have ranks in [Ice Magic](../../../../rules/ranks/elemental magic/ice magic.md) you can make your natural attacks deal +2 cold damage and stagger your targets whenever you inflict a permanent injury.

## Rank III 

Increase your resistance to physical damage by 1.

<u>Fluid form:</u> As a standard action you can surround yourself with a barrier of fluid waters, protecting yourself from physical and magical attacks. While this barrier remains active all damage you suffer will be reduced by 2 and a 10-foot area centered on you becomes [difficult terrain](../../../../rules/main rules/combat rules.md#difficult-terrain). You can suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of the currents, increasing the damage reduction by 2 for one round and granting you advantage in defensive rolls. To use this ability you must be in contact with 5 or more cubic feet of water and it cannot remain active for more than one minute at a time.

<u>Elemental connection:</u> Water is a source of life for your body. When you start your turn in contact with water or submerged in it you regain 1 Vitality. You will not be able to heal your HP in this way, but by taking a short rest in an area with a high presence of your element (rivers, lakes, seas or rain) you recover all your HP as if you were taking a long rest. If you take a long rest in this area reduce the level of all permanent injuries affecting you by 1 step. In addition, if you use water in a First Aid check you will not consume a use of this ability and will heal 1 additional HP. At rank V every round you remain in contact with water you will heal 1 HP or 2 Vitality.

## Rank IV 

Increase your CHA by 1. You can replace the attack bonus you have in a specific weapon with your elemental magic bonus.

<u>Water column:</u> You are able to move through water without suffering penalties to your movement. You are also able to propel yourself on a column of water, which will grant you a flight speed of 30 feet while it remains active (a water column cannot make you fly more than 45 feet high). A water column can only be used if you are in contact with an area of water larger than the height you intend to rise and to maintain this ability you must spend a move action or take 2 non-lethal damage. 

<u>Infused attacks:</u> Your attacks are as adaptable as water, shifting nimbly from attack to defense. You receive the ability to reposition, permitting you to move 5 feet as a bonus action whenever you successfully defend yourself from an attack (if you already have this ability you can move 5 additional feet with it). In addition, once per round you can enter defensive position as a bonus action whenever you successfully damage an enemy. If you have ranks in ice magic your weapon attacks will inflict +2 cold damage and whenever you deal hit point damage with them your target will become staggered.

## Rank V 

Increase your resistance to physical damage by 1 and your magic resistance by 3.

<u>Element of change:</u> Your defenses are capable of adapting themselves to your current situation. You gain resistance to fire damage equal to your rank and at the beginning of your turn you can choose gain resistance equal to your rank against a status effect of your choice (some possibilities are [bleeding](../../../../rules/main rules/status effects.md#bleeding), [burned](../../../../rules/main rules/status effects.md#burned), [confused](../../../../rules/main rules/status effects.md#confused), [sickened](../../../../rules/main rules/status effects.md#sickened), [staggered](../../../../rules/main rules/status effects.md#staggered) or [frightened](../../../../rules/main rules/status effects.md#frightened)).

<u>Echolocation:</u> You gain blind sight in a 30-foot range. You are also able to predict the movements of creatures that are on the same water surface as you, preventing you from being surprised by them and granting you the ability to repeat an attack or defense roll once per round.

## Rank VI

Increases your DEX by 1.

<u>Elemental Form:</u> As a full-round action you can surround yourself with a large mass of roaring waters. While you are in elemental form you are constantly surrounded by a wall of water and using water column now costs a move action (this effect now lasts until you lose concentration). Additionally, the defense bonus granted by Fluid form increases by 2 and all water within 30 feet  is under the effect of [Raging Currents](../../../../rules/ranks/elemental magic/water magic.md#rank-iii). In addition, all physical attacks you make will push your target 1d6 x 5 feet on hit. Elemental form will last a number of rounds equal to your rank + 1 or until you lose concentration on it. This ability will also be lost if you are hit with a Rain of embers.

<u>Chosen of the spirits:</u> You have become a champion blessed by the spirits themselves. Their blessings grant you resistance 4 to mind-effects, poisons and diseases, and you body ages ten times slower. Spirits will never be naturally hostile against you and they will treat you with great respect.
