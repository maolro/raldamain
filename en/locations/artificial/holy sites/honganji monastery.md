title: Honganji monastery
---

Honganji is a former spiritual monastery located in eastern Shinri renowned for its relationship with the new Incarnate. Built in a forbidding mountain range to guard over the seals trapping dark spirit Go-Niyasho, the monastery remained isolated from most events that struck Shinri and due to its acceptance of anyone who reached its location it would become a home to many of the land's outcasts. The new Incarnate would take refuge in this monastery while he fled from warlord Hidetsu Takenaga, but even its strong defenses were not enough to save it from destruction at the hands of the Takenaga army. The monastery itself would be restored by Shinri hero and former monk Shizen, who turned it into a martial arts dojo. Even though it is safe once more, the discovery of massive chi deposits in the region by the Mirai corporation and the opening of a chi mine to exploit these resources has left its future in a precarious situation.
