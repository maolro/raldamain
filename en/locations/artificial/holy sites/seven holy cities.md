title: Seven holy cities
---

Built out of the desert sands with the artifact Agha Iryan, the Seven holy cities are sacred to the Temash people and formed the heart of the Tamashkhan empire. At their peak they had populations reaching tens or even hundreds of thousands and were centers of science and culture. Unfortunately for the Temash these days are long gone and their holy cities have fallen to ruin or foreign conquest. Even though their era of glory has passed, the memory of the Seven holy cities lives on in Temash tales and songs ensuring that they will forever endure no matter their current state.
