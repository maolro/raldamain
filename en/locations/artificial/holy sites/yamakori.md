title: Yamakori mountain
---

Yamakori is the highest mountain in Shinri and considered to be the home of the ice spirit [Seiryuu](../../../creatures/superior beings/primal spirits/shinri/seiryuu.md) by popular tradition. Because of this the mountain is considered a sacred place for the [Katamashi clan](../../../ideas/factions/katamashiclan.md) who traditionally would take their newborn children to the high mountain so they can be gifted the power of elemental ice by Seiryuu himself. While once both the clan and the spirit were at peace, numerous atrocities committed against the Katamashi clan and Seiryuu's forced sealing by the [Seishin-Gumi](../../../ideas/factions/seishingumi.md) have made the ice spirit develop a hatred for humanity which will undoubtedly lead to a great tragedy if he is ever released.
