The decadent heart of [Mazarin](https://raldamain.com/en/locations/natural/mazarin.html), Svaikal was once a city of great hope that has become nothing that a shell of what it once was. Its old marble building seem to be falling apart and large parts of the city have always remained in perpetual disrepair no matter who ruled the nation. To many it is a symbol of Mazarin's failure itself, always falling into ruin no matter who sits on its throne. Nevertheless, its hardy people still have hope for a shining future and fondly remember those days when Svaikal was a capital worthy of its name, inspiring powerful bonds between them and pushing them to improve the city one step at a time so it can finally reach its true potential.
