Built on the ruins of one of the [First empire](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/nations/first_empire.html)'s great flying cities, the city of Andir stands proud as the spiritual capital of the [Chothgar](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/sentient/human-like/chothgar/) people as the homeplace of their prophet [Meisodh the Traveller](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20triumph/meisodh.html). When it first fell from the heavens its ruined shell became a home to the Chothgar as they searched for a safe place to protect themselves from the chaos which followed the fall of the First Empire. Once Meisodh united the Chothgar people he turned this ruined city into a worthy capital for his emerging empire, making it one of the largest and most beautiful cities of Kimon itself. Even after his death and the fragmentation of the Chothgar people this city remained as a holy place they all respected, becoming the seat of power for the Traveller's church and its spiritual leadership.
