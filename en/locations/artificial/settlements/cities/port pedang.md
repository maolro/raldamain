Known as the city of fortune and delights, Port Pedang is well known for its reputation that one can enter it poor and leave it covered in riches. Due to its proximity to the domain of the spirit of fortune [Tomii-Koyatu](../../../../creatures/superior beings/primal spirits/shinri/tomiikoyatu.md) luck often smiles on the people of Port Pedang, but the riches one can gain just as easily can be lost once misfortune strikes. The city has historically been very rich thanks to its position as an important seaport, but due to strong competition from [Klonum](klonum.md) and Jaminikai it shifted its main industry to gambling and entertainment. While Shinri's most respectable lords often look down as this city as nothing more than a den of vice it remains an extremely popular destination for those ambitious and foolish enough to gamble it all in the hopes that Tomii-Koyatu will make them rich.
