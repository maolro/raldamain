The traditional seat of the [Hibotoru clan](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/factions/hibotoruclan.html), Iwakashi is the most prosperous city in northwestern Shinri thanks to its strategic position in the Shinri-Iskarian trade route. This city has been destroyed and rebuilt multiple times throughout its history because of the many wars and natural disasters that ravaged the region, caused in part because of the city's proximity to the tempramental fire spirit [Suzakushin's](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/superior%20beings/primal%20spirits/shinri/suzakus.html) domain. Just as the phoenix rises again from the ashes the city has always managed to survive and return to its former strength even after great calamities.

# History

## Origin

The region was settled by Drakutian colonists in the mid-31st century, coinciding with their push towards the Shinri interior as they desired more fertile land to support their growing cities. They would choose the shores of an inland lake to establish a small village which in time would grow to become the city of Iwakashi. 

Legends tell that the patriarch of the Hibotoru clan stole the secrets of fire from the flame spirit Suzakushin and gave them to his people so they could prosper, starting an ancient feud between the two. They would fight many years later in a great clash that caused devastating damage to the small settlement, and while the first Hibotoru lord was no match to the powerful spirit Suzakushin was so impressed with his valor that he gifted the hero with parts of his essence, granding him the power to create fire. This power would pass down through generations of the Hibotoru clan, granting them elemental fire magic.

Once the First Incarnate created the first Shinri state the Hibotoru clan were the first to accept his rule, gaining a privileged position in the new nation. Due to their great military strength they would often clash with the emperor's authority and in occassion they were the true rulers of the nation in times of weak emperors. This was the time of Iwakashi's first golden age as the trade route with the nearby nation of Iskaria would begin to develop and bring great riches to the city. 

## Age of warlords (3919-4022)

Good times would not last as a civil war between rival branches of the Hibotoru clan would trigger a calamitous chain of events which concluded in the death of the Shinri royal family and the collapse of central authority in the land, throwing it into a prolonged era of feudal lords. Iwakashi would be destroyed several times in massive fires caused by fights between powerful Hibotoru clan leaders, massively reducing its population and influence. 

Once infighting died down the city had a chance to rebuild, quickly growing in population as many fled behind its walls escaping war and banditry. Iwakashi would carry on for a few decades more until the opening of spirit gates in 4010 by the Oni caused Suzakushin to enter the world once more, causing a disastrous fire that claimed the lives of many of members of the Hibotoru main family. 

This incident also caused even more destructive consequences for the city as the northern [Katamashi clan](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/factions/katamashiclan.html) demanded more fertile land from the Hibotoru after their patron spirit Seiryuu also entered the material plane and cursed their land with eternal winter. The Hibotoru's refusal would trigger a decade-long border war with the Katamashi, cutting the city from the Iskarian trade route and causing a great economic crisis. It was only thanks to the brilliant leadership by lord [Jiro Hibotoru](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/jiro.html) that the clan managed to hold itself together and overcome these challenges, ensuring that the clan would remain secure and prosperous in these trying times.

The city gained national attention in 4022 when Incarnate [Renshin](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/renshin.html) was hosted by lord Hibotoru and the clan officially announced it would back his claim to unify all Shinri, starting a war against the rival [Takenaga clan](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/factions/takenagaclan.html) who wished the same goal. Iwakashi would become the den of many plots and intrigue by members of both great clans as the Takenaga sent spies to try to turn lord Hibotoru's vassals against him. The city would face a brief period of chaos after Jiro died in battle against the Takenaga as factions close to the old lord and friendly to lord [Hidetsu Takenaga](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/hidetsutakenaga.html) fought in the streets for control. This abruptly ended with Takenaga's assassination and the ascention of Jiro's son [Kaimon](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/kaimon.html) to the position of clan leader, returning peace once more to the clan.

## War of two incarnates (4025-4027)

Kaimon was renowned in Hibotoru clan history as a peacemaker, helping bring an end to the age of warlords and marrying [Megura](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/megura.html), a member of the Katamashi clan, to bring peace between both ancient enemies. He strongly collaborated with the elven mage [Edenor](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/edenor.html) to bring prosperity and development to the clan, funding the construction of Shinri's first chi foundry. The [restored Shikurai clan](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/factions/newshikuraiclan.html) also established itself near the city, counting with support from the city's governor lord [Yoshiko Imada](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/yoshikoimada.html). They would act as the clan's secret police force, fighting against the [Akatora-Tai](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/factions/akatoratai.html) criminal organization who attempted extend their influence into the city.

Iwakashi's internal politics would face a powerful change when the [Seishin-Gumi](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/factions/seishingumi.html) began their conflict with the true Incarnate [Seigo](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20heresy/seigo.html) and his companions. To neutralize their influence they went after their allied factions in Iwakashi, taking over the chi foundry and forcing the Shikurai to flee the city. Yoshiko was unaware of this secret war, believing the Seishin-Gumi's lies that Seigo was an impostor who wanted to bring chaos to Shinri. During the war of the Two Incarnates that followed the foundry maximized its production to arm the Hibotoru army, creating many jobs for the city.

To defeat the numerically superior Hibotoru armies the true Incarnate's faction hatched a secret plot with the Oni to open Suzakushin's spirit gate once more, unleashing the fire spirit's wrath on Hibotoru lands. Suzakushin's rage was immense, ravaging crops and burning large parts of Iwakashi itself. While the spirit was eventually contained by Kenamaru and the Seishin-Gumi, the destruction it caused would trigger a massive revolt against Kaimon incited by Seigo's agents, who claimed Suzakushin's wrath was due to the Hibotoru clan fighting against the true Incarnate. Kaimon's wife Megura, a close ally of Edenor, supported the rebels and they quickly took control of the clan, pulling it out from the war and pushing it to join the Shinri alliance.

## Shinri alliance and empire (4027 onwards)

With SeigoÂ´s ascension and the creation of the Shinri alliance the city of Iwakashi recived large amounts of investment from Edenor's business, the Mirai corporation, for rebuilding and developing the city. He also lobbied the government to reestablish the trade routes with Iskaria create new trade agreements with the elves to make Iwakashi once more into a vital trade nexus. 

Now that Shinri is mining vast amounts of raw chi the trade routes will be extremely lucrative for all those involved and Iskaria has also given large loans to the Hibotoru clan to assist with the city's reconstruction. It waits to be seen if these policies will be successful but without a doubt they are putting Iwakashi on the right track.

# Geography

The city of Iwakashi is located in the Horii plain, a large and fertile flatland which greatly helped the city's development. It is located on a small plateau near Ember lake to ward off floodwaters, a strategic location which allows it to establish a powerful freshwater port. The city's climate is humid subtropical, having hot, humid summers and dry winters. Due to the influence from the fire spirit Suzakushin the land's summers are known to be especially hot.

# Economy

For a long time trade was Iwakashi's key economic sector due to its position in the Shinri-Iskarian trade route, being a common stop for trade caravans and having an important market where merchants could exchange goods. This sector was heavily harmed in the Age of warlords but it managed to succesfully recover with the reunification of Shinri. 

Iwakashi is also well known for its ceramics and traditional pottery, dating back to the city's foundation. It also has a strong manufacturing sector which began with the establishment of the Sindarae chi foundry and continued throughout the 41st and 42nd centuries, making Iwakashi into one of Shinri's most prosperous cities.

# Culture

As a powerful trading city and seat of the Hibotoru clan culture flourished in Iwakashi during the first Shinri state. The clan lords and many wealthy merchants were great patrons of the arts, drawing many actors and playwrights to the city in search of the opportunities it gave. While its culture took a hefty blow it never recovered due to the Age of Warlords there is still hope that with reunification it may prosper again. The city's most important landmark is Iwakashi castle, traditional home to the Hibotoru, which looms over most of the city displaying the might and glory of the sons of fire.
