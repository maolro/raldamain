Renowned as the unbreakable city, many great empires have tried to breach the great walls of Feyn's Throne only to fail and lose it all. While the city dates back to the time of the old Ustilian kingdom it only began to take its current form under the Ustilian empire as its emperors built three great walls blessed by Feyn himself to protect the city. For a long time it was the largest and most populated city in the Continent and served as a living testament to the might of the Ustilian empire. The city's most radical change came with the death of Feyn and the rise of the Inheritor, changing its identity and even its name to Sek-Tessos to honor the empire's new god and adapt to changing times. 

# History

## Origin

The city was officially founded with the union of the kingdoms of Deverent and Elyon into the first kingdom of Ustilus as the nascent state set the foundations for a new capital which belonged to neither kingdom. Legends say that when king Arimion, first monarch of the Ustilus, had a vision from the god Feyn himself instructing him to build a great city which would become his throne once he returned to earth, finishing it in they year 2639. The city was named Feyn's Throne in honor of the king's vision and throughout his lifetime the first walls were built and blessed by Feyn to last for millennia. 

## Kingdom of Ustilus (2639-3324)

Feyn's throne would face its first challenge when the Tamashkhan empire sent a great army north to conquer the land of Pradjati, bridge between north and south Raldamain. This would trigger nearly a century of holy war and the city itself was besieged for the first time by the Temash, who after a lengthy struggle eventually were forced to turn back in defeat. 

The city would face two more sieges in the centuries that followed, one by rogue Mazarine soldiers who attempted to sack the city and another by fanatical Feynist rebels who sought to overthrow the monarchy. After the kingdom's enemies failed time and time again the city began to receive a reputation of being invincible which would carry on until the present day.

## Destruction by the Rakashite empire (3324-3496)

The darkest period in the city's history took place with the conquest of Ustilus by the Rakashite empire, a brutal people from beyond the western sea who followed the demon god Sek-Tebos. Ustilian historians would often omit this period when chronicling the city's history as the Rakashites were the first to successfully capture the city after a lengthy siege. To show the Ustilian people the price of resistance the Rakashites razed the city to the ground leaving nothing but scorched ruins. 

While most of the population was forcibly displaced and the city remained abandoned for decades its ruins would serve as a hideout for the Ustilian resistance, who waited for a right time to free their nation from the Rakashites. An opportunity arose after the death of the godlike Rakashite emperor threw his land into a prolonged succession war. A popular general named Akrodios would join the side of the resistance and liberated the former Ustilian kingdom's heartland with his army. He made the ruins of Feyn's throne into his capital and fortified it once more, resisting multiple sieges by Rakashite armies thanks to his strategic brilliance and Feyn's belessings. Akrodios also claimed to receive a vision that Ustilus would rise again and become humanity's greatest empire, writing that Feyn himself would become its ruler in the year 4000.

## Ustilian empire (3496-4000)

Akrodios proclaimed the formation of the restored Ustilian kingdom in 3496 and made Feyn's throne into his new capital, rebuilding its walls as Arimion did long ago. The city would finally finish construction under Akrodios' son Kleonas, who began setting the foundations for the city's second ring of walls after the city began to massively grow in population. These walls would stand another siege centuries later by the Hobgoblin Legion, adding another great victory to its long list of achievements. 

As the kingdom transformed into an empire and the Ustilian economy massively grew with new conquests future emperors began to spend massively to improve the capital, hoping to forever cement their legacy and create a capital worthy of humanity's greatest empire. Some of these improvements were the construction of the Basilica of Feyn the emperor, the Ustilian royal parliament and the city's innovative plumbing and sewer system. When the empire reached its peak in the 40th century it finished construction of its third wall and its population reached a historical high at 700.000, solidifying its position as greatest city of the continent.

## Feyn's death and the Purification war (4000-4010)

The year 4000 after Feyn's ascension was hotly anticipated by the Ustilian people as the date of Akrodios' prophecy had finally come. A day of great hope swiftly turned to crushing despair when dark clouds suddenly covered the city and the city's high priest died on the spot, proclaiming with his last breath that the great god Feyn was dead. Following this announcement all of Feyn's clerics lost their divine powers and all attempts to contact the god were in vain. Thus began a period of turmoil for the empire where its very existence hung on a thread.

The death of Feyn wracked the city with political instability and division as the Ustilian parliament's two main factions, the Reformists and Imperialists, feuded over power and the influence as they desired to fill the void after Feyn's death. In response to growing revolutions in the empire the Knights of Ustilus proclaimed a state of emergency in 4002 and forcibly took power in an action many defined as a bloodless coup. During the emergency the Ustilian parliament was shut down and many politicians who vocally opposed this action were arrested by the authorities. 

The emergency lasted until 4005 after Grand Master Abshalom of the knights died in battle and was replaced by Fileon, a more moderate leader. Once most large rebelliones in the nation were crushed Fileon relinquished power to the Parliament and married the Reformist leader Ileria in an action that healed past wounds. Ileria would become the empire's prime minister and after the ascension of the reformist-aligned Theodora to the throne Ustilus entered a brief period of liberalization and progress. Feyn's throne was temporarily freed from the restrictive power of the Feynist church and philosophy, art and a free press began to flourish. The Ustilian constitution of 4006 was the culmination of this period, a powerful document that limited the powers of the monarch and granted many rights to the people.
