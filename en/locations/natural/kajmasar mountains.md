The Kajmasar region is a massive elevated plateau located in the center of [Raldamain](https://raldamain.com/en/locations/continents/raldamain.html) which is the ancestral home of the Leonin people. Due to its cold and inhospitable climate it was untouched for most of its history and allowed the Leonin to survive the extinction of most non-human races in the continent. This region has an important place in the history of [Arshalan](https://raldamain.com/en/ideas/nations/arshalan.html) as the prophet [Mekhatim](https://raldamain.com/en/characters/age%20of%20triumph/mekhatim.html) fled to this land escaping persecution and was taken in by the [leonin](https://raldamain.com/en/creatures/sentient/human-like/leonin.html), who would become the first converts to her faith. Because of this some of Arshalan's holiest monasteries and temples are located in this land, attracting many mekhatimist pilgrims from around the world who are willing to brave its rugged climate for the hope of divine blessings.
