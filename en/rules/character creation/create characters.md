title: Character creation
---

The Raldamain system is an innovative role-playing system that aims to be easy to use and with infinite possibilities. Unlike other systems, there the concept of classes does not exist in Raldamain and it is usable for all kinds of fantasy or sci-fi worlds with minimal adjustments. The basis of character creation is in the rank system, where the player can select a set of skills to build a unique character. 

## The six stats

All ranks revolve around six basic stats, which will be detailed in this section. The value you have in a certain stat will be added to all attack, defense and talent rolls related to it. The six stats are the following:

- **Strength**: Strength (STR) measures the character's muscle and physical power. Strength rolls are those that require great physical effort, such as swimming against the current or escaping from a grip. This stat is necessary  for skills related to melee combat, such as heavy blades, bludgeoning weapons or martial arts. Your strength stat will also modify all damage rolls you make with a weapon.
- **Dexterity**: Dexterity (DEX) measures a character's agility and accuracy. Dexterity rolls are those related to precise or agile movements, such as moving stealthily or walking on narrow surfaces. This stat is necessary for skills related to swift and deadly attacks, such as light blades and ranged weapons. Your dexterity stat will also modify defensive rolls made to dodge attacks.
- **Constitution**: The Constitution (CON) measures a character's health and vigor. This stat will be used to calculate a character's HP and Vitality, as it will be specified in the next section. While there are no constitution talents or related skills, it is recommended to have a good value in it to survive in combat. Nevertheless, you can roll Constitution defensively to protect yourself from certain effects that target your body, such as poisons, diseases and blood magic.
- **Intelligence**: Intelligence (INT) measures a character's knowledge and memory. Intelligence rolls are those related using your mind, such as remembering information or solving puzzles. This stat is necessary for skills related to arcane magic and certain types of occult magic.
- **Wisdom**: Wisdom (WIS) measures a character's awareness and insight. Wisdom rolls are those that related to using your senses and intuition, such as perception and first aid. This stat is necessary for skills related to divine and natural magic. You can also roll wisdom defensively to protect youself against fear and mind-effects.
- **Charisma**: Charisma (CHA) measures a character's eloquence and willpower. Charisma rolls are related to using the right words to manipulate others, either to persuade or decieve. This stat is necessary for skills related to social situations, such as Presence and Influence. Charisma is also used for elemental magic and in certain skills can allow you to use it instead of other mental stats for spellcasting.

At level 1 you have the values 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0 to distribute among your six stats. In addition, you can reduce one of your stats by 1 to increase another by 1 (maximum 3). Every time you reach an even level (2, 4, 6...) you can increase one of your stats by 1, reaching a maximum of 6 (9 if you are level 12 or higher).

## HP, Vitality and Defense

The next step to create a character is to determine the Hit Points (HP), Vitality  and Defense (DEF). These three values are essential for a combat and measure the character's capacity to endure attacks.

- **HP**: HP measure the health of the character and his ability to endure lethal damage. They are equivalent to 3 + CON at level 1, and increase again by 1 every time you go up 3 levels (i.e. at level 4, 7, 10, 13...). Whenever a character loses hit points from lethal damage they will suffer one mild injury, and if they are reduced to 0 they will immediately fall unconscious and begin dying. A dying character will lose 1 HP at the beginning of their next turn until they receive healing, and will die if their HP becomes equal to thier negative CON stat (for example, a character with 2 CON will die if they reach -2 HP). 

- **Vitality**: Vitality measures a character's physical endurance capacity. Vitality is equal to 2 + CON + the character's level. All damage taken by character will go to vitality first instead of HP, including non-lethal damage. If a character's Vitality reaches 0  all future damage taken will become lethal.

- **Defense**: Defense is a value that reduces the damage you suffer. Defense depends on the armor you wear and your natural endurance, known as natural armor (humans start with 0 natural armor). The amount of defense a certain suit of armor grants can be found [here](../ranks/combat/armor.md).

  Similar to defense are resistances, which are mostly supernatural abilities which grant you the ability to ignore some damage of a specific type. Resistances can protect you against either physical damage, energy damage or arcane magic, and the add up with each other.

HP and Vitality are reduced or increased if you suffer any change to your constitution stat. With a short rest you recover all your Vitality and HP equal to your level/3 (rounded up), while with a long rest you recover all your HP and Vitality.

## Talents

Talents represent your proficiency in various abilities unrelated to skill ranks. Your proficiency with a talent is marked by the  talent level, which ranges from 0 to 5. At level 1 a character have has four levels to distribute among all talents, reaching a maximum talent level of 2. Every time a character gains a level they will gain an additional talent level to distribute. A complete list of talents can be found [here](talents.md).

## Skills

Skills form the basis of the Raldamain system and define the nature of a character. Each skill has a specific number of ranks, which represent the level of mastery a character has in it. You get 2 ranks of your choice at level 1, and at each subsequent level you gain an additional rank in a specific skill. You cannot reach a skill rank higher than your level divided by 2, rounded down (i.e. at level 5 you cannot have an ability ranked III). With the consent of the GM a player can slightly modify the attributes that a skill rank grants to better suit the character they seek to build. A compilation of skills can be found [here](../ranks.md).
