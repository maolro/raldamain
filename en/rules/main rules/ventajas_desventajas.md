Advantages and disadvantages represent those moments in a combat that can allow one side to win or lose. Good use of advantages is key to victory, allowing a player to avoid deadly attacks or to hit a nimble enemy. The basic uses for advantages and disadvantages are as follows:

## Advantages

**1 VNT:** Add one Advantage or Disadvantage die to your next roll. You may add a maximum of three dice in this manner.

**1 VNT:** Move 5 feet in any direction without provoking attacks of opportunity.

**1 VNT:** Defender suffers 1 non-lethal damage from combat fatigue. You do not need to hit to inflict non-lethal damage in this manner. 

**2 VNT:** Take an additional [move action](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/reglas%20de%20combate.html#acci%C3%B3n-de-movimiento). You may only use this ability once per round, either on attack or defense.

**4 VNT:** The target suffers a minor permanent wound. You can only spend advantage in this way if you hit with your attack and manage to deal damage.

**4 VNT:** Target is disarmed if it uses Parry to defend itself. You must spend 1 additional advantage on this ability for each point of resistance your target has against combat maneuvers.

**4 VNT:** An event of great fortune occurs for you. This event is chosen by you, and some possibilities are that you discover a weakness your enemy has, destroy an object your target is carrying, or perceive a hidden person in your field of vision.

## Disadvantages

**1 DSV:** A slightly positive event occurs that allows you to add one Advantage or Disadvantage die to your next roll. You may add a maximum of three dice in this manner.

**1 DSV:** Move 5 feet in any direction without provoking attacks of opportunity.

**1 DSV:** Defender suffers 1 non-lethal damage from combat fatigue. You do not need to hit to inflict non-lethal damage this way. 

**2 DSV**: Take an additional [move action](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/reglas%20de%20combate.html#acci%C3%B3n-de-movimiento). You can only use this ability once per round, either on attack or defense.

**4 DSV:** Make an attack of opportunity against your target as a reaction. Making attacks of opportunity like this costs you 2 disadvantage less for attacks that require you to spend a move action. You may not expend disadvantage in this manner if you are defending against an attack of opportunity nor make more than one attack of opportunity per round against the same person.

**4 DSV:** The target is disarmed if he attempts to attack you with a weapon. You must defend with Parry in order to spend disadvantage in this manner. You must spend 1 additional disadvantage on this ability for each point of resistance your target has against combat maneuvers.

**4 DSV:** An unfortunate event happens to your enemy. This event is chosen by you, and some possibilities are that his firearm gets stuck or explodes, that he gets so distracted that an ally of yours manages to feint him, or that he loses concentration on an effect he is maintaining.
