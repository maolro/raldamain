title: Status effects
---

This is a list of the most common status effects that a creature could endure.

### **Bleeding** 

A bleeding creature takes 1 damage at the beginning of its turn from blood loss and increases the level of all permanent wounds affecting it by 1 for every two rounds this effect remains active. Bleeding can be stopped by a successful First aid ability check or with any supernatural ability that heals damage. Multiple bleed effects stack with each other and every additional bleed effect will increase the difficulty roll to heal this effect by 2.

### **Blinded**

A blinded creature has difficulty perceiving its surroundings. It reduces its field of vision to 10 feet and cannot defend itself from attacks it cannot perceive. Additionally, its movement is reduced by 10 feet, other creatures receive advantage on attack rolls and it has disadvantage attacking adjacent creatures. If the creature has a way to perceive its surroundings without needing sight it will lose penalties to movement and attacks due to blindness.

### **Burned**

A burned creature will suffer an amount of fire damage per turn depending on the severity of the burn. A mild burn inflicts 1 fire damage per turn while a medium burn inflicts 2 fire damage per turn. Above the medium burn is the severe burn, which increases the fire damage it inflicts by 1 each turn it remains active, starting at 2.

Burns can cause permanent wounds if they remain active for an excessive number of turns. Thus, a mild burn increases the severity of wounds by 1 on the body part after a number of rounds according to its severity, being every three rounds for a mild, every two for a medium, and every round for a severe (the first round does not apply). If a creature has several active burns the damage from these does not accumulate but may increase the severity of several permanent wounds.

Damage done by burns will ignore fire resistance although they can only be provoked if the target suffers fire damage. To remove a burn it is necessary to immerse the affected body part in water or a cold environment for one round. In addition, a character can spend a standard action to reduce the severity of a burn from medium to mild.

### **Confused** 

A confused creature acts in an irrational manner and is unable to distinguish allies from enemies. A confused creature will move in a random direction and attack the nearest creature, chasing it until it dies or escapes its field of vision. If a confused creature is in a combat it will not move randomly and can decide which actions to use, but it will not receive any flanking advantage and is immune to beneficial effects granted by allies (such as Commanding voice or Inspire Heroism). This effect ends when the creature exits combat.

### **De**afened 

A deafened creature cannot hear sounds clearly. It is immune to effects that require hearing such as Commanding voice, but will automatically fail all Perception rolls that require hearing. A deafened creature will also have disadvantage in all skill rolls and attackers have advantage against it.

### Despaired

A despaired creature has lost the strength to continue fighting, resigning itself to defeat. It loses all morale effects it has active and it must stop attacking immediately. A despaired creature can still fight to defend itself, but attackers will receive an advantage in attacks against it and it will have disadvantage in all attacks. If a despaired creature has its sanity reduced to 0 it will immediately attempt to commit suicide.

### **Entangled**

An entangled creature has its movements hindered. It reduces its movement by 10 feet and adds a -2 penalty to its dexterity stat. If the creature is succeed in a Heroism or Sleight of hand check against the entangling creature or effect. Attempting to escape from entanglement costs a move action.

### Exhausted

An exhausted creature reduces its movement by 15 feet and reduces its STR and DEX by 2. In addition, each action it takes will deal 2 non-lethal damage to it. This status effect is removed with a long rest, and a short rest will make a character fatigued instead of exhausted.

### Fascinated

A fascinated creature fixes its attention on a particular source, neglecting the surrounding environment. It will not be able to roll perception to detect hidden creatures and it will receive disadvantage in initiative checks if combat takes place. If an event occurs that poses a clear threat to the fascinated creature, such as a visible enemy approaching it, it can do attempt Perception check against the fascinating effect to free itself. This effect is automatically lost when a fascinated creature suffers damage.

### **Fatigued** 

A fatigued creature reduces its movement by 10 feet and reduces its STR and DEX by 1. Fatigue does not stack with itself, and if a creature becomes fatigued again it will become exhausted. A creature will gain this effect if it spends a whole day without doing a long rest or if it is reduced to 0 HP.

### **Frightened** 

A frightened creature attempts to flee from the source of its fear, using its actions to run or hide. It will not willingly approach the source of its fear and will only fight if cornered. A frightened creature receives the same penalties for fighting as if it were shaken.

### Grappled

A grappled creature cannot move and will be unable to dodge attacks made by adjacent creatures (it gains disadvantage dodging ranged attacks). It also has disadvantage on all its attack and combat maneuver rolls except to escape from the grapple. To escape from a grapple the creature must succeed in a heroics check against its grappler. Attempting to escape from a grapple costs a move action.

### Invisible

An invisible creature is almost impossible to perceive by sight due to its great stealth or a magical effect. It will have advantage on all its stealth ability checks and attempting to spot an invisible creature with perception will cost a standard action. An invisible creature is also immune to targeted attacks and precision damage and it will have advantage on all dodge checks.

### **Nauseated** 

A nauseated creature is unable to concentrate due to sickness or great pain. It automatically fails all its skill rolls and it is unable to spend standard actions.

### **Panicked** 

A panicked creature attempts to run away as fast as it can from the source of its fear, using its actions to flee. It may not attack the source of its fear even if cornered, and may only use its abilities that help it escape. This status effect gives the creature the same penalties in combat as shaken.

### **Paralyzed**

A paralyzed creature cannot move or take actions, remaining frozen in its position. This ability will remain active until the creature  succeeds in a CON or STR check against the source of its paralysis. Attempting to escape paralysis costs a move action.

### **Prone**

 A prone creature falls to the ground, reducing its speed by 15 feet and gaining disadvantage on all melee weapon attack rolls. However, it will also gain advantage dodging ranged attacks. Standing up costs a move action and it will provoke attacks of opportunity.

### **Shaken** 

A shaken creature will have disadvantage on all its attacks and ability checks. If it is attacked by the source of its fear the attacker adds will gain advantage on attack rolls.

### **Sickened** 

A sickened creature will have disadvantage on all its attack, defense and ability rolls. This status effect can be caused by either disease, poison or permanent wounds.

### **Staggered** 

A staggered creature loses a move action and reduces its DEX by 1. It can still perform standard and bonus actions normally.

### **Stunned** 

A Stunned creature cannot use actions or reactions and must it drop all items it is carrying except those attached to its body. This effect lasts for one turn or until the creature is hit by an attack. If a flying creature becomes stunned it will begin to fall.
