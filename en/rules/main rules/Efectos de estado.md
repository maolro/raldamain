This is a list of the most common status effects that a creature can endure

### **Bleeding** 

A bleeding creature suffers 1 lethal damage at the beginning of its turn from blood loss and increases the level of all permanent wounds on the affected party by 1 for every two rounds that this effect remains active. Bleeding can be stopped by a successful First Aid roll or the application of any healing skill. If a creature suffers this effect again the damage does not accumulate but may increase the severity of permanent wounds on other parts of the body.

### **Blinded**

A blinded creature has difficulty perceiving its surroundings. It reduces its field of vision to 10 feet and cannot defend itself from attacks it cannot perceive. Its movement is reduced by 10 feet, other creatures receive an additional Advantage die on attack rolls and it adds a Disadvantage die to all its attack rolls against adjacent creatures. If the creature has a way to perceive its surroundings without needing sight it will lose penalties to movement and attacks due to blindness.

### **Burned**

A burned creature will suffer an amount of fire damage per turn depending on the severity of the burn. A mild burn inflicts 1 non-lethal damage per turn while a medium burn inflicts 2 non-lethal damage per turn. Above the medium burn is the severe burn, which increases the non-lethal damage it inflicts by 1 each turn it remains active, starting at 2.

Burns can cause permanent wounds if they remain active for an excessive number of turns. Thus, a mild burn increases the severity of wounds by 1 on the body part after a number of rounds according to its severity, being every three rounds for a mild, every two for a medium, and every round for a severe (the first round does not apply). If a creature has several active burns the damage from these does not accumulate but may increase the severity of several permanent wounds.

Damage done by burns will ignore fire resistance although they can only be provoked if the target suffers fire damage. To remove a burn it is necessary to immerse the affected body part in water or a cold environment for one round. In addition, a character can spend a standard action to reduce the severity of a burn from medium to mild.

### **Confused** 

A confused creature acts in an irrational manner and is unable to distinguish allies from enemies. A confused creature will move in a random direction and attack the nearest creature, chasing it until it dies or escapes its field of vision. If a confused creature is in a combat it will not move randomly and can decide which actions to use, but it will not receive any flanking advantage and is immune to beneficial effects granted by allies (such as Voice of the commander or Inspire Heroism). This effect ends when the creature exits combat.

### **De**afened 

A deafened creature cannot hear sounds clearly. It is immune to effects that require hearing such as Voice of the Commander or Divine Word, but will automatically fail all Perception rolls that require hearing. Attackers add an additional Advantage die to their rolls against it and it will add a Disadvantage die to its skill rolls.

### Despaired

A despaired creature has lost the strength to continue fighting, resigning itself to defeat. It loses all the morale effects it has active and must stop attacking immediately. If it continues in the combat it will be able to fight to protect itself, but any creature that attacks it will receive an additional Advantage die in its attack roll and it will receive a penalty of one Disadvantage die. If a despaired creature has its sanity reduced to 0 or an event happens to it that makes it rethink its existence, it will immediately attempt suicide.

### **Entangled**

An entangled creature has its movements hindered. It reduces its movement by 10 feet and adds a -2 penalty to DES. If the creature is entangled by an attack, such as Chains or Nature Magic, it cannot move more than 5 feet away from the entangling creature, in addition to being unable to Dodge the entangling creature's attacks. To escape from an Entanglement requires a successful Heroism or Sleight of Hand roll against the attack roll of the entangling creature (if no creature entangles you, the roll is up to the master to decide). Attempting to escape from entanglement requires a move action.

### Exhausted

An exhausted creature reduces its movement by 15 feet and adds 2 difficulty dice to all its STR and DEX rolls. In addition, each action it takes will deal 2 non-lethal damage. If a creature is fatigued by any effect and is already exhausted, it will not receive the effects of fatigue. This status effect is removed with a long rest.

### Fascinated

A fascinated creature fixes its attention on a particular source, neglecting the surrounding environment. It will not be able to roll perception to detect hidden creatures and its priority will be reduced by 2 in case a combat occurs. In case an event occurs that means a threat to the fascinated creature, such as a visible creature approaching it, it will be able to roll Perception against the effect that is fascinating it, freeing itself from it if it succeeds. This effect is automatically lost when it suffers damage.

### **Fatigued** 

A fatigued creature reduces its movement by 10 feet and receives a -1 penalty to its FUE and DES. Fatigue does not accumulate, and if a creature becomes fatigued again it will become exhausted. Fatigue is removed with a short rest. You may receive fatigue if your Vitality is reduced to 0 or you go a full day without sleep.

### **Frightened** 

A frightened creature attempts to flee from the source of its fear, using its actions to run or hide. It will not willingly approach the source of its fear and will only fight if cornered. A frightened creature receives the same penalties for fighting as if it were frightened.

### Grappled

A grappled creature cannot move and receives a -2 penalty on Dodge rolls. It also adds a Disadvantage die to all its attack and combat maneuver rolls except to escape from the grab. Attempting to escape costs a move action with which the grappled creature must succeed on a Heroism roll against the Heroism value of whoever is grappling it.

### Invisible

An invisible creature is almost impossible to perceive by sight due to its great stealth or a magical effect. Add an additional challenge die to all your defensive stealth rolls and spotting the creature with perception requires the expenditure of a standard action. No targeted attacks can be made on invisible creatures and they may cancel an additional success on defensive rolls. 

### **Nauseated** 

A nauseated creature is unable to concentrate. It automatically fails all its skill rolls and loses a standard action per turn.

### **Panicked** 

A panicked creature attempts to flee as fast as it can from the source of its fear, using its actions to flee. It may not attack the source of its fear even if cornered, and may only use those abilities that help it escape. This status effect gives the creature the same penalties as frightened.

### **Paralyzed**

A paralyzed creature cannot move or take actions, remaining still in one place. It functions like stunned, but will not end until it succeeds on a CON or FUE roll depending on the cause of its paralysis against the appropriate difficulty roll. 

### **Prone**

 A prone creature falls to the ground, reducing its speed by 15 feet and adding two Disadvantage dice to melee weapon attack rolls. However, it adds one Difficulty die to its defensive rolls against ranged attacks and receives partial cover. Getting up costs a move action and provokes attacks of opportunity.

### **Shaken** 

A shaken creature adds one Disadvantage die to all its rolls. If it is attacked by whoever is causing it fear the attacker adds one Advantage die to its roll.

### **Sickened** 

A sickened creature rolls a Disadvantage die on all its attack and ability rolls. In addition, all attackers will receive one Advantage die against it. This status effect can be caused by either disease, poison or permanent wounds.

### **Staggered** 

A staggered creature loses a move action and adds a difficulty die to all its dexterity rolls. It can still perform standard and bonus actions normally.

### **Stunned** 

A Stunned creature cannot use actions or reactions, and must drop all items it is carrying except those attached to its body. The Stun lasts for one turn or until the creature is hit by an attack. If a flying creature becomes Stunned it will begin to fall.
