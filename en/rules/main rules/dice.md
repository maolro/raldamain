The Raldamain system is centered around six special dice which will decide the outcome and consequences of any action a character will take. Dice can either be positive, which represent the skill of a character attempting a certain task, or negative, which represent the difficulty of it. The official Raldamain dice roller can be found [here](https://raldamain.com/dice/eote.html).

The main dice of the Raldamain system are the following:

# Positive dice

Positive dice are used for skill and attack rolls and are based around the character's stats and certain skill-based and environmental modifiers. These dice will generate successes, which determine if the attempted action succeeds or not, and advantages, which can be spent regardless or success or failure to achieve certain bonuses. Successes cancel failures and advantages cancel disadvantages.

## Boost

Boost dice represent small advantages that aid in the completion of a task, such as a favorable position or a good strategy. These dice can either be gained by spending advantages or through certain skill ranks. The GM can freely reward boost dice according to the situation and the player's choices. 

Boost dice are light blue and have a cubic shape. When these dice are rolled defensively convert to setback dice.

## Ability

Ability dice directly represent the skill of a certain character in whichever task they try to achieve. They depend directly on a character's stats and form the basis of any skill or attack roll.

Ability dice are green and have eight faces. When these dice are rolled defensively convert to difficulty dice.

## Proficiency

Proficiency dice represent the training and expertise a character has in a certain area, such as combat or knowledge. These dice can only be gained through talents or skill ranks and when added they will always substitute an existing ability dice. Proficiency dice can generate a unique result known as a triumph, which represents phenomenal a phenomenal success. A triumph can only be cancelled by a despair result and it can be converted into two successes or four advantages.

Proficiency dice are yellow and have twelve faces. When these dice are rolled defensively convert to challenge dice.

# Negative dice

Negative dice represent the difficulty of achieving a certain task and are mostly assigned by the GM. These dice are also used for defensive rolls, in which case they directly depend on the defending character's skills and stats. These dice will generate failures, which cancel success results and determine if the action achieves its desired result or not; and disadvantages, which can be spent to give unfortunate consequences to a success or make a failure even more disastrous.

## Setback

Setback dice represent small disadvantages which can potentially harm the success of achieving a certain task. While in most cases these dice are given by the GM according to the situation and the environment, a player can spend advantage or disadvantage results to add them to a defensive roll.

Setback dice are black and have a cubic shape. They are the negative equivalent to boost dice.

## Difficulty

Difficulty dice represent the direct degree of difficulty of a certain task. The exact amount of difficulty dice any roll has directly depend on the GM and in defensive rolls they are equal to the stat the character uses for defense.

Difficulty dice are purple and have eight faces. They are the negative equivalent to ability dice.

## Challenge

Challenge dice represent great risks a certain task might have which are dangerous even to professionals. These dice will be added by the GM if the task is especially hard or if the defending character has proficiency dice in the skill they use for defense. When adding a challenge dice it will substitute a difficulty dice already present in a roll. Challenge dice can generate a unique result known as despair, which represents a catastrophic failure. A despair result can only be cancelled by a triumph and it can be converted into two failures or four disadvantages.

Challenge dice are red and have twelve faces. They are the negative equivalent to proficiency dice.
