title: Prioridad
---

Priority is a value that represents the order of turns in a round, deciding who can act first and the order of resolution of actions.  

In a round the character with the highest priority will start, who will be able to perform a standard or movement action. After that his priority will be reduced by 1 and the turn will pass to the person with the highest priority value (in case of a tie, the character who has not taken action yet will act first).A character can have several consecutive turns if he continues to have the highest priority value after taking action and still has unspent actions left, and each consecutive attack made in this way will receive a bonus of one ability die.  The round will end when all the characters taking part in it have spent their actions completely. 

A creature can voluntarily save its actions until the right moment. If a creature chooses to save action its priority will be reduced to the priority of the next creature in the round, continuing until it decides to take action or the round ends. 

The priority value is equivalent to a character's skill statistic. For those characters that have the same priority value the order will be decided by the type of weapon they use, which is ordered as shown in the following table.
