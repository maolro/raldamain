These are the main cultures and species appropriate for a Knights of Ustilus campaign.

## Humans

### Ustilians

Chosen by the god of humanity, the people of Ustilus believe they are destined for greatness and dream of leading humanity into a new golden age. These great ambitions have led to their greatly inflated egos, and in the name of destiny the Ustillians have waged many devastating wars to expand their great empire. Now that Ustilus has become the strongest human-led nation in the Continent and the belief in Feyn's salvation has never been stronger.

Religion and law are fundamental parts of an Ustilian’s life. To an average citizen, Feyn is the one true god of humanity and all other entities are otherworldly spirits and tricksters that lead humanity on a path of lies. Their faith has led them to believe the Ustilians are superior to all other humans by the virtue of being chosen by their god, but they are also willing to cooperate and are tolerant towards those that treat them with respect and subservience. Laws are another important part of their life, often blindly following superiors and orders thinking they are most probably right and just.

Ustilians can be found in all major lands of the Continent, eager to spread their culture and knowledge to everywhere they can find. They form the ruling class of all Ustilus-held provinces, where they sometimes interbreed with the locals to forge united dynasties. Because of this, many Ustilians have traits from other cultures, specially Shinri, Kratoic and Temash. 

Due to the aforementioned diversity, Ustilians have varying skin tones, most common of which are somewhere between fair and olive. Their hair is either brown, black or auburn, and their eyes can be brown, hazel or blue.

### Temash

Ancient dwellers of the southern deserts, the Temash have seen countless civilizations rise and fall back into the sands they have sprung from. They know well that everything in existence is finite and will one day fade away, giving them a somewhat nihilistic outlook. At the same time, the Temash believe strongly in the importance of stories and legends, thinking that while all people will die in the end, tales of their exploits will live on for generations.

The Temash organize themselves in extended family groups known as tribes, each one protected by a guardian elemental spirit. This elemental spirit can bestow its magic on certain members of the tribe, teaching them the secrets of elemental magic. The individuals chosen by the spirit are extremely valued by the tribe and often become heroes or great leaders.

Currently the Temash lands are held by the great empires of Arshalan and Ustilus, but its native peoples know that someday these great empires will fall too, leaving nothing more than ruins in the desert. Some tribes accept this occupation, while others fiercely oppose it and cause great trouble to their would-be conquerors. Ustilian repression is especially harsh, forcing many of the Temash to retreat into the great Southern deserts and await the right time to strike back with all their might.

The Tempash typically have skin of tanned and brownish colors along with dark hair and eyes. Some tribes completely cover themselves in desert garb in the presence of outsiders, revealing their faces only to those they trust.  

### Jaddites

The Jaddites are the valiant riders of the endless wastes, living strictly by their noble code and bringing order to lawless lands. They are a beacon of civilization and law in an otherwise savage land, but their constant time under attack by the desert´s monstrous inhabitants has forced many Jaddites to emigrate away and settle in the more prosperous lands in the north. This has led to conflicts between the Jaddi and the native Temash in the deserts, creating an old enmity between the two cultures. When the empire of Ustilus arrived at the Southern Continent, they found loyal allies in the Jaddi who would help them conquer the Temash. Now, the historical roles of the two have been reversed, with the Jaddi controlling the southern lands while the Temash chafe under their leadership.

Jaddite culture has been historically nomadic, with large clans migrating from one place to the next searching for a secure haven where their people could live in peace. Each clan has a unique code of laws that they zealously follow to the letter. These laws are what keeps the clan united and failure to follow them usually results in death or exile. Even though their rules are harsh, the Jaddi tes are one of the most charitable peoples in the Continent, making sure that the poor and elderly in their tribes are well taken care of and are often lend a helping hand to lone travelers they meet.

The Jaddite cavalry is one of the most feared fighting forces of the Continent, renowned for their fierce endurance and bravery in the face of certain death. They can be found in serving the Ustilian armies all around the empire’s lands and guarding the legendary fortress known as the Citadel from the monsters of the wastes. Many Jaddites are fierce followers of Feyn and often become Knights of Ustilus, with some even entering the Conclave or becoming Grand Masters. 

Jaddites have dark brown skin and eyes. Their hair is mostly black, and they traditionally braid it once for each victory they achieve.  A Jaddite rider has great devotion towards his horse, treating it as a fellow companion and hero. Their full names are composed of their personal name, the name of a previous relative who has died and their clan name

### Shinri

As diverse as the nature they worship, the Shinri are innovative and creative, but at the same time bound by their ancient ways and traditions. Originally from a faraway continent, the Shinri settled in the territory known as the Woodland Provinces millennia ago, bringing with them their culture and knowledge. Their arrival brought hostility from the local spirits and triggered many devastating wars, but in the end a legendary hero known as the Incarnate brought humans and spirits together, creating an ancient truce that lasts to this day. 

Many Shinri are blessed with elemental powers, giving them the control over the four classical elements. Those are known as Takai and hold great prestige in Shinri society, often becoming rulers and heroes of legend. Elemental dynasties stretch on for centuries and their stories say that they descend from the mythical spirits themselves. 

The Shinri homeland is full of untamed wilderness and secretive groves where gates to the Spirit World can be found. At the same time, there are also great and powerful cities such as Klonum or Homay that serve as homes for hundreds of thousands of individuals. In recent times the Shinri lands have become consumed by war between the expansionistic Ustilus empire and the Shinri clans. The conflict has completely broken all central authority and the lands remain under the control of feudal warlords and Takai clans who fight the Ustilian invaders as well as each other for supremacy.

Shinri generally have light skin, black hair, and brown eyes. Those gifted with elemental powers may have unique traits, such as different-colored eyes or special markings on their skin

### Iskarians

Forged in fire and blood, the Iskarian people have had a long history marked by war and suffering. But after winning their freedom and building an independent nation with the help of Ustilus the Iskarians finally had a chance to leave their past behind them and reach a new era of peace. With peace came stagnation and corruption, and some disaffected groups have begun to recall the glorious days of old and desire make Iskaria a strong nation once again.

Iskarians descend from the same ancestors as the Shinri and share many traditions with them, such as spirit worship and affinity with nature, but the many years they have spent under the rule of the Hobgoblin Legion have had a long-lasting effect on their culture and beliefs. Even though now they are a peaceful people, these old influences can still be visible in their great skill at metalworking and the strong bonds of loyalty they feel towards each other.

In the present day Iskarians have a nominally independent country, but Ustilus still has great control over their politics and economy. Iskarian politics are dominated by a small clique of half-elven noble families which use corruption and nepotism to remain in power and keep commoners out of government. This unequal situation has bred tensions between half-elves and humans in Iskaria and it has given strength to extremist movements which seek to return Iskaria to its past glory.

Iskarians are physically similar to shinri since both of them normally have light skin, dark hair and brown eyes. Amber eyes are more common due to the prevalence of fire elemental bloodlines.

### Kratoics

They say freedom runs in the Kratoic people’s blood. After many centuries living undisturbed on the edges of civilization have made them traditional and hardy folk. Foreign empires have again and again conquered the Kratoic lands, but every time its people would run to the hills and forests where they would keep fighting until they get their lands back, even waging war for centuries until that occasion. 

In religious terms, Kratoic people have had a longstanding worship of the old gods, but decades of religious conversion by Feyn’s priests have made them adopt a double faith. They are amongst the most tolerant of peoples, able to easily collaborate with others of different cultures, mindsets, and faiths. They specially get along well with the Tandor elves and the Shinri because of their common ancient faiths, but relationships with the Mazarines are more strained because of the many centuries Kratoi spent under their subjugation. 

Kratoi is often called Ustilus’s crown jewel because of its faithfulness, good quality of life and abundance of natural resources. Ustilus' often benevolent rule has allowed the province of Kratoi to greatly develop, becoming a land of business, opportunity, and great thinkers. The way the Kratoics see it, so long as Ustilus leaves them alone and does not curtail their freedom they will serve the empire as loyal citizens and work hard to guarantee its prosperity. 

Kratoics often have skin tones ranging from fair to tanned and hair often brown and black. Blond hair is not rare either, specially from those with Mazarine ancestry. Their eyes are either brown, blue or green

### Mazarinos

Heirs of the greatest empire of times past, the Mazarines are stuck in a period of decadence as a mere shadow of what they could have been.

### Dairovios

Rodeados del miedo y la superstición, los dairovios son bien conocidos por su poder sombrío y tendencia a la brujería. 

## Non-human

### Elfos

Los elfos representan todo aquello que la humanidad aspira a ser. Inmortales, bellos y con talento innato hacia la magia, los elfos son el primer pueblo conocido que ha pisado el continente.

### Semielfos



### Hobgoblin
