title: Talents

Talents represent your proficiency in various skills not related to ranks. Your proficiency with a skill is marked by your talent level, which ranges from 0 to 5. At level 1 you have four talent levels to distribute (at most you can reach 2), and at each subsequent level you receive an additional talent level. Each talent is associated with a stat, which is indicated in the Talent List.

The benefits that the talent levels grant you are as follows:

| Level | Benefit                                                      |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | +1 proficiency die in associated rolls                       |
| 2     | If the stat related to your talent is 2 or less, increase it by 1 |
| 3     | +1 proficiency die in associated rolls                       |
| 4     | If the stat related to your talent is 3 or less, increase it by 1 |
| 5     | +1 proficiency die in associated rolls                       |

## Talent list

### Athletics (FUE)

You have proficiency in climbing, swimming, or long-distance running. One of your speeds (swim, climb or base) increases by 5 feet each time you gain a new talent level. This can reach a maximum speed of 45 feet.

### Acrobatics (DES)

You possess a fine sense of balance and great flexibility. You are proficient in skill rolls to move across tight surfaces, make acrobatic jumps, and avoid falls. Each level of Acrobatics increases your horizontal jump speed by 5 feet and vertical jump speed by 1 foot.

### Insight (SAB)

You have a sense of intuition that allows you to detect lies. You receive fluency on rolls to determine if the person you are interacting with is lying to you. The target must roll Deception if they are lying to you, and if you succeed you will know for certain whether or not they are lying to you. Find out intentions does not work on creatures with masks.

### Wreck (FUE)

You are proficient in shots to break objects or cause damage to structures. Making a wreck ability roll costs you a standard action and on hit you deal damage to the object depending on the weapon you use. An object rolls defensive dice depending on its hardness and has HP determined by its size and material. Here are some examples of object stats.

### Deception (CAR)

You are adept at lying in a way that makes it appear as if you are telling the truth. When a creature tries to use intent to detect if you are lying, you have a roll roll of your own to avoid detection. You will receive penalties on this roll determined by the master if your lie turns out to be implausible. If a player tries to use Find Out Intentions on you, you can communicate your results secretly to the master so that the other player does not know if you are using Deception or not. Deception can also be used to communicate secret messages to an ally without another character knowing or resist Perception rolls to try to identify you if you are wearing a disguise.

### Memory (INT)

You are an expert in fields related to a subject. You are fluent in rolls to remember or know information related to a specific subject. Each time you gain a talent level you can choose a different subject in which you are fluent. Some knowledge topics to choose from are engineering, history, medicine, theology, chemistry and cryptography. You can also choose as a subject to know the traits, history and behaviors of a specific extraplanar culture or race.

### Heroism (FUE)

You are able to use your physical strength to perform great feats on the battlefield. You have fluency in attack rolls to perform combat maneuvers (Grapple, Trip, Thrust or Disarm) and to attack with improvised weapons. You can use your Heroism dice to defend against combat maneuvers, and you can cancel an enemy-generated hit once per turn at talent level 2 (2 times per turn at talent level 4).

### Intimidate (FUE)

You use your strength to demoralize your opponents without the need to make an attack. You have fluency in rolls to demoralize opponents or to pressure a creature weaker than you to do favors for you by force. The target will roll defensively with Strength (or Intimidate if you have it) if you seek to demoralize it or Charisma if you seek to pressure it. A creature you pressure will do the favor for you but its attitude will be reduced by one level.

### Sleight of hand (DES)

You have the fluency in throws to pick locks, steal other people's belongings, or perform simple magic tricks. If you seek to make a sleight of hand shot against a person watching you they will roll Perception defensively to detect if you attempt it. Using this ability in combat costs you a standard action (full turn action if you seek to fiddle with a lock).

### First Aid (SAB)

You instinctively know how to stabilize an injured person. As a standard action you can stabilize a creature with 0 or fewer hit points. If you use First Aid on a creature that is already stabilized you can remove the effects of Bleeding and heal HP equal to the number of talent levels you have. You can only use First Aid in this way in combat a number of times per day equal to your talent level and only once per rest. You do not consume a use of this ability if you have the appropriate material to heal.

### Perception (SAB)

Your senses allow you to notice details and alert you to danger. You are proficient at rolls related to sight, hearing, and smell, and at noticing details in your surroundings. If a creature tries to hide it will resist with its Stealth skill against your Perception. Using Perception to notice details and identify hidden creatures costs you a move action.

### Persuasion (CAR)

You have fluency in rolls to change people's attitudes on a given subject and to convince them of a given action. The difficulty roll varies according to the opinion of your interlocutors towards you, increasing the difficulty if they are more hostile. Persuasion does not allow you to change the attitude of the people you interact with or to ask them for favors too risky, actions that can be performed with Influence ranks.

### Stealth (DES)

You are adept at avoiding detection. You are adept at shooting to hide and move silently. Hiding is a move action only usable if you have some kind of cover or concealment. If you attack a creature that has not noticed your position, it will count as a surprise attack and it will not be able to defend itself. Being hidden you can still move without attracting attention, but you will move at half speed. You automatically abandon stealth when you make an attack.

### Survival (SAB)

You are proficient at shooting to survive in a wild environment or to follow creature tracks. The difficulty roll is decided by the master and depends on the danger of the environment and factors related to the creatures you track (for example, the number of creatures and how recent the tracks are). Your Survival levels increase with ranks in Tracking.
