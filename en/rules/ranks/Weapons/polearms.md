# Ranks

## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with polearm weapons. 

<u>Protect allies:</u> The long reach of your weapon helps you protect nearby allies from attacks. Whenever an ally within reach of your weapon is attacked as a reaction you can add your polearm rank to all defensive rolls that ally makes. While you can protect nearby allies with your weapon, its long reach poses a hindrance when defending yourself against adjacent enemies which will gain advantage against you if you parry with a polearm weapon.

<u>Brace:</u> You can spend a move action to brace yourself against an upcoming charge. If you have braced your weapon you can do an opportunity attack against a creature that passes through a square in reach of your weapon at any moment of the round. This attack will deal +1d6 damage and on a hit the target must stop its movement immediately. 

## Rank II

<u>Adjust reach</u>: You can adjust the position of your hands to increase or decrease the reach of your weapon. With this ability you can change your reach by 5 feet as a move action, reaching a maximum of 15 ft. If you reduce your reach to 5 ft you lose the ability to protect allies with your weapon in exchange for losing the penalty on defensive rolls, while if your reach increases to 15 ft add an additional disadvantage die to defensive rolls against adjacent enemies. Adjust reach can be used once per turn as a bonus action at rank IV.

<u>Sidesweep strike:</u> As a full-round action you can attack all creatures in a 10 foot cone. Whenever you successfully strike a target this way you can do a free trip maneuver against it using your weapon attack modifier. A sidesweep strike will stop immediately if a defender succeeds in a defensive roll with a shield against your attack.

## Rank III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Expert flanker:</u> Your weapon deals extra damage equal to your dexterity stat against targets you are flanking. The benefits of flanking apply to your attacks against all targets within your reach that are adjacent to an ally. Expert flanker will not affect creatures that are immune to flanking.

<u>Shifting strike:</u> Your mastery with polearms lets you perform complex combat maneuvers. When you successfully strike an enemy you do a free disarm or feint maneuver for which you can your weapon modifiers. Attacking with polearm weapons now cost you a move action.

## Rank IV

<u>Circular strike:</u> Sidesweep strike now costs you a standard action. As a full-round action you can attack all creatures within the reach of your weapon. Targets that are hit with your weapon will be automatically pushed 5 feet back. A circular strike will stop under the same circumstances as Sidesweep strike.

<u>Polearm charge:</u> Your weapon deals +1d6 damage when doing a charge. Whenever you hit a target after doing a charge you can choose to pierce it with your weapon. A target which is pierced by your weapon will reduce its speed by 10 ft and it will have disadvantage in all of its rolls. You can also spend a move action to move a pierced target 10 feet in any direction. Removing a pierced weapon costs a move action and on doing so the target will receive a mild injury (if the body part that you hit already had a permanent injury removing a pierced weapon will increase its level by 1 instead).

## Rank V

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20.

<u>Sudden charge:</u> If you spend a move action to brace yourself against a charge, at any point during the round you can make a charge as a reaction. A charge made this way will gain bonuses from both brace and polearm charge and all permanent injuries inflicted with this attack will increase by one step. 

<u>Reposition</u>: Your weapon acts as an extension of your body, allowing you to use its momentum to reposition yourself. Whenever you successfully parry an attack you can move 5 feet in any direction as a reaction without provoking opportunity attacks. 

# Weapons

A base polearm weapon deals 1d8 piercing damage and has a reach of 10 feet. A base polearm can be modified with the following features to produce all kinds of similar weapons:

- <u>Throwing</u>: The weapon can be thrown from a distance of 20 feet, functioning as a ranged weapon. For this attack you will use your dexterity instead of your strength and the effects of Brace and Sudden charge will still apply.
- <u>Slashing</u>: The weapon has a slashing blade at its tip, making it deal slashing instead of piercing damage. You will also receive Sundering strike instead of Shifting strike at rank III and all permanent injuries inflicted with this weapon will inflict bleed.
- <u>Staff</u>: The weapon is blunt at its tip, making it deal bludgeoning instead of piercing damage. You gain Power attack at rank I and Concussion at rank III, but you will not be able to pierce enemies with your weapon and its base damage will be reduced to 1d6.
- <u>Hooked</u>: The weapon has a hook on its tip that allows you to easily grab your targets. It reduces its base damage to 1d6 but whenever you damage a target you can pierce them with your hook. This works the same way as when you pierce an enemy with Polearm charge. When you reach rank IV whenever you strike an enemy after a charge you can reduce their armor's defense by 2.
- <u>Giant</u>: The weapon is extremely large and unwieldy. A giant weapon increases its reach by 5 feet and increases its damage to 2d6 (1d10 if it is a staff or hooked weapon), but it must be used with both hands unless you are mounted. This weapon can only be used by characters with STR 4 or higher and all attacks made against adjacent creatures have disadvantage.
- <u>Mancatcher</u>: The weapon has a semicircular claw on its tip that can be used for grappling. A mancatcher weapon reduces its base damage to 1d4 but on hit it will automatically grapple your target. Using a move action you can squeeze your target with your claw, inflicting 1d4 + STR piercing damage to it. At rank III whenever you squeeze the defense of your target's armor will be reduced by 2. A mancatcher's claw can be covered with spikes, inflicting bleed whenever you damage a grappled target.
- <u>Double</u>: The weapon has a second tip with which you can perform attacks. When making an attack with your weapon once per turn you can declare it as a double attack, by with you can do a second attack as a bonus action in exchange for receiving a -2 penalty in both attacks. At rank III you can apply all weapon attributes to your second attack and at rank V you will lose all penalties when doing double attacks.
