## Rank I

Add your Slashing blade rank to attack and defense rolls with weapons of this category. All [permanent injuries](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/main%20rules/Heridas%20permanentes.html) inflicted with a slashing blade will cause [bleeding](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/main%20rules/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#bleeding).

<u>Fierce Slash:</u> Your attacks are very effective against unarmored enemies. Whenever you deal damage with your weapon to a target whose armor grants it 2 or less defense it will begin bleeding and all permanent injuries you inflict will increase their level by one step. If your target is wearing natural armor it will count as if they were not wearing armor. You can also cause bleeding whenever you make a critical hit or harm an enemy unable to defend himself.

## Rank II

<u>Great cleave:</u> You can spend a full turn action to attack all creatures within a 15-foot arc. Your cleave will stop immediately if a creature blocking with a shield succeeds in its defensive roll.

<u>Power Attack</u>: You are able to trade accuracy for greater attack strength on your attacks. This ability allows you to declare an attack as a Power Attack, which will grant you a -2 penalty on attack rolls in exchange for inflicting +2 base damage. At rank IV you can increase the penalty by -2 to inflict 2 additional points of damage.

## Rank III

Increases your critical hit threshold to 19-20.

<u>Sundering strike:</u> Hitting an armored target with a Power Attack will reduce its DEF by 2. This reduction can be removed by repairing the armor, and if the armor's defense is reduced to 2 or less it becomes unusable (which counts as not wearing armor for the effects of Fierce Slash). This ability allows you to make a Sunder maneuver against your target's armor as an attack, for which you use your weapon's bonus against your target's heroism and you will reduce his DEF by 2 if you succeed.

<u>Trap blade</u>: Using your skill with your weapon you are capable of locking your enemy's sword in yours to restrict their movements and preventing them from attacking you. Whenever you succeed on an attack you can choose to trap your enemy's weapon instead of dealing damage. An enemy with a trapped weapon will not be able to use parry to defend against attacks from other creatures and they will not be able to attack you until they manage to free their blade. In addition, disarming an enemy in this situation will cost you a move action instead of a standard action. Freeing a sword from this grip works in the same way as escaping from a grapple.

## Rank IV

<u>Whirlwind of Steel</u>: Using great cleave now costs you a standard action. You can spend a move action when making Great cleave to attack all creatures adjacent to you. Using Great slash in this way counts as an area attack and will do half damage against creatures that succeed in their defense. This ability can still be stopped by a shield.

<u>Shield Breaker</u>: Your powerful attacks are capable of weakening and even shattering shields. If a creature with a Shield succeeds in parrying a Power Attack it will reduce its defensive bonus by 1. If the shield's defensive bonus reaches 0 it will be destroyed and cannot be used to protect you from attacks. 

## Rank V

<u>Sequence of slashes:</u> Your sword is able to attack with great speed. Making an attack with your weapon now costs you a move action and each consecutive attack in the same round against the same target will increase your attack roll by 1 and base damage by 1.

<u>Severing Slash:</u> When you make a powerful attack against an enemy against 2 or less defense you increase the level of all permanent wounds on it by two steps. If you manage to cause a severe wound with this ability you can immediately cut off the affected body part body part it is an arm, a leg or head.

# Weapons

A base slashing blade weapon deals 1d8 slashing damage and has a range of 5 feet. A slashing blade weapon can be modified with the following trait to create all types of related weapons.

- <u>Heavy</u>: The weapon is larger than normal size, increasing its base damage to 1d10 at the cost of requiring it to be used by two hands. You also have disadvantage parrying against light weapons. If you have strength 6 or more you can hold a heavy weapon with one hand.
- <u>Light</u>: The weapon is smaller in size and easier to use. A light weapon reduces its base damage to 1d6, but you will be able to use your DEX stat for attack rolls made with it. If the weapon is a sword it will lose the Power Attack attribute at rank II and you will receive sneak attack instead (this remains the same for a light axe). For the purposes of two-weapon combat you can choose the piercing blade branch, even if the weapon is in slashing blade category.
- <u>Double</u>: The weapon has a second blade with which you can make attacks. When making an attack with your weapon you can declare it a double attack, allowing you to make an additional attack as a bonus action at the cost of receiving a -2 penalty on both attacks. When you reach rank III you can apply your weapon abilities to your second attack and at rank V you will have no penalty on a double attack.
- <u>Axe</u>: The weapon is an axe instead of a sword. An axe increases your base damage to 2d6 (2d8 if heavy and 2d4 if light) but you will not be able to use Parry to defend yourself against attacks made by light weapons. At rank III you receive the attribute mighty charge instead of trap blade.
- <u>Throwing</u>: The weapon can be thrown a distance of 20 feet, functioning as a ranged weapon. You will use you DEX instead of your STR for attacks made with thrown weapons and power attack, sundering strike and shield breaker will continue to apply. This trait can only be applied to light weapons.
- <u>Serrated</u>: The blade of the weapon is equipped with several small blades that cause severe wounds on impact. All bleeding effects inflicted with this weapon will deal +1 damage per turn and will increase the effectiveness of a permanent wound it has by one step each round. Nevertheless, the blades are fragile and if you use Sundering strike you will lose all benefits they provide.
- <u>Blade Breaker:</u> The weapon has several wedges on the blade with which it can break the swords of your enemies. If the enemy defends with a Parry attack against a Power Attack you can grant its weapon a -2 penalty to damage. If a weapon with this penalty manages to inflict 0 damage in a damage roll it will break instantly. A weapon with this bonus gains the drawback of being more fragile, making it reduce its damage by 1 whenever it strikes a target with 6 or more defense or a wall.
