## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack rolls made with firearms.

<u>Deadly aim:</u> Your attacks are especially deadly when striking enemies at close range. When attacking a target within 30 feet of you you will ignore any defense they have for natural and manufactured armor (this is 15 feet for a handgun) and any permanent wounds you cause will increase their effectiveness by one step. Before making an attack you can add a -2 penalty to your attack roll to increase the distance at which you can use deadly marksmanship by 15 feet.

<u>Gunslinger's Agility:</u> Drawing your weapon costs you a move action (this costs you a bonus action if it is a handgun). You also your initiative by 1, and increase it again when you reach rank III and V.

## Rank II

<u>Quick reload:</u> Reloading a weapon costs you a move action, while reloading large weapons require a standard action. You can use a move action to make an additional attack with your weapon.

<u>Bullet Trick:</u> Your expert marksmanship allows you to use your attacks in an unexpected way to weaken your opponent's defenses. Instead of attacking you can use your gun to perform one of the following effects on an enemy:

- **False Shot:** Your target must defend himself by figuring out intentions. If it fails it will be incapable of dodging your next attack as if it was a feint.
- **Thundering shot:** The shot causes a thunderous boom, causing your target to become disoriented. It must defend itself by making a Constitution roll, and on failure it must move 10 feet in a random direction and is Shaken until its next turn.
- **Lucky Shot:** Your target must defend itself using Dodge. If it fails it will drop a small object it is carrying on its body, such as a potion, a bomb or a side bag. If the object is particularly fragile it will be destroyed by your bullet.

## Rank III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Precise shot</u>: Your attacks have become much more precise, allowing you to ignore any obstacle that provides neither cover nor complete concealment. When attacking a target affected by deadly marksmanship it will lose all defensive bonuses granted by cover and concealment. This ability will not work as already specified against enemies with cover or full concealment.

<u>Sniper's Eye</u>: By carefully aiming your attacks you are able to fire deadly shots at even more distant enemies. You can use a move action to increase your deadly aim radius by 15 feet without taking a penalty. In addition, you can add your dexterity stat to your damage rolls against targets unable to defend themselves.

## Rank IV

<u>Shot on the run</u>: You can move before and after shooting, distributing your total movement as you wish (15 feet before and 15 feet after, for example). You will also suffer no penalties when shooting mounted or in a moving vehicle.

<u>Rain of lead</u>: Once per round you can use a bonus action to make an additional attack with your weapon. This ability can also be used to provide cover fire to an ally of your choice, allowing you to make a defensive roll using your attack modifiers to protect them. 

## Rank V

Increases your critical hit chance to 18-20.

<u>Vital Strike</u>: By striking an enemy unable to defend itself with deadly aim you are able to deal it a lethal blow. An attack made this way will multiply your base damage by 2 and inflict a severe permanent wound when it damages your target.

<u>Expert marksmanship</u>: Your attacks are able to hit the target's weak points. By using a move action to aim a shot you can make the defender unable to use shield or magic to block your attack. This ability will not work against characters that are in a defensive stance (it also does not work against those in defensive form).â€ƒ

# Weapons

A base firearm deals 2d6 piercing damage, has an average range of 90 feet, and takes a standard action to reload. This weapon is made for campaigns set in the renaissance era, but is also suitable for more modern campaigns with appropriate upgrades. A base firearm can be modified with the following traits to give rise to all kinds of related weapons as long as the characteristics chosen are not incongruous.

- **Handgun**: The weapon can be used one-handed, reducing its base damage to 2d4 and its distance by 30 feet in exchange for greater ease of use. Handguns require only one move action to reload and can be used in two-weapon combat.
- **Chamber**: The weapon has a chamber with which it can hold multiple bullets. The chamber allows the weapon to fire 6 shots before it must be reloaded. A chambered weapon is typical of campaigns set in the industrial era or the old west. 
- **Buckshot**: Instead of bullets the gun will fire a shower of lead pellets. A pellet gun must be chambered and when attacking will hit all creatures in a 15 foot cone when firing and inflict 2d8 piercing damage (2d6 if it is a handgun). However, a pellet gun reduces its maximum distance to 30 feet.
- **Double barrel**: The weapon fires two bullets per turn with one attack at the cost of making it more difficult to use. Such a weapon will have 2d8 base damage at the cost of adding a -2 penalty to all attack rolls. This enhancement cannot be applied to handguns.
- **Powerful**: A powerful weapon fires bullets with greater power, but will have a high recoil force. A weapon with this enhancement will increase its base damage to 2d8 (2d6 if it is a handgun, 3d6 if it is a pellet gun) but each attack made with it will receive a -2 penalty for each previous attack made in the same round.
- **Automatic**: The weapon has a system for firing bullets automatically. Making an attack automatically costs you a standard action and you may attack every creature within a 30-foot cone, starting with the nearest one. These attacks will consume 4 bullets, but will add 1d6 to the base damage on hit. Weapons with this ability will chamber 40 bullets and are typical of modern era or sci-fi campaigns.
- **Sniper**: The weapon can shoot at targets at a longer distance and eliminate them with a single bullet. As a standard action you can aim your weapon, increasing your range to at most 200 feet away. In this state you will receive the Sneak Attack ability and you can use Deadly Aim if you make a surprise attack against your target. Weapons in this category are typical of modern era or sci-fi campaigns.
