# Ranks

## Rank I 

Add your rank to all attacks made with ranged weapons.

<u>Piercing shot</u>: By taking aim you can strike your target's weak points to ignore their armor. This ability lets you spend a move action so your next attack will ignore 2 points of your target's defense. Instead of spending a move action once per attack you can take a -2 penalty to attack rolls to ignore 2 additional defense points. This ability can be used twice per attack at rank III and three times at rank V.  

<u>Sneak Attack:</u> Your attacks are especially effective against vulnerable targets. Add your dexterity stat to all damage rolls made against surprised targets or those flanked by two of your allies. This ability only works against targets less than 30 feet away unless you take a -2 penalty to attacks for every additional 30 feet of distance. 

## Range II

<u>Expert Archer:</u> Your expert aim lets you use your attacks in unexpected ways to weaken your target's defenses. Instead of attacking you can use your weapon to do one of the following combat tricks: 

- **False shot**: Your target must defend itself with Insight. If it fails it will be incapable of dodging your next attack as if it was a feint.
- **Disarming shot**: Your target must defend itself with Heroics. If it fails it will immediately be disarmed of whatever weapon it is carrying.
- **Lucky shot:** Your target must defend itself using Dodge. If it fails it will drop a small object it is carrying on its body, such as a potion, a bomb or a side bag.

<u>Quick attack:</u> Making an attack with your weapon now costs you a move action. You can now make opportunity attacks with your weapon whenever you roll a critical hit on your defense or if your enemy rolls a critical miss on its attack.

## Range III 

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Precise shot</u>: Your ranged attacks have become even more precise, letting you ignore all obstacles that do not provide total cover or concealment. Whenever you use aim against a target you will also ignore all penalties given by cover an concealment on your next attack.

<u>Sniper's Eye:</u> Your perfect aim lets you strike targets at even further distances. Whenever you aim an attack reduce all distance penalties by 2, including those for sneak attacks. 

## Range IV

<u>Shot on the run:</u> You can move before and after attacking, distributing your total movement as you wish. You also don't suffer penalties when shooting from a mount or on a moving vehicle.

<u>Rain of arrows</u>: Once per turn you do an extra attack with your weapon as a bonus action. You can also use your weapon to provide cover fire for your allies, allowing you to add your ranged weapon rank to the defensive roll of an ally within 60 feet. Cover fire can only be used if you are in defensive position.

## Range V

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20.

<u>Vital strike:</u> Whenever you strike an enemy whose defense has been reduced to 0 with precise attack all damage you inflict will be multiplied by 2. If you can use sneak attack on your target you can automatically inflict a severe permanent injury on hit,

<u>Expert marksmanship</u>: Your attacks are able to hit your target's weak points. If you spend a move action to aim your shot can make the defender unable to use his shield or magic to block your attack. This ability will not work against characters in defensive position.

# Weapons

A base bow deals 1d8 piercing damage and has a range of 60 feet. You can shoot enemies at a maximum of 90 feet by receiving disadvantage to your attack. A base bow can be modified with the following features to produce all types of related weapons.

- <u>Composite</u>: The bow requires great strength to be drawn but it will increase the power of arrows fired. You need to have STR 3 or more to use a compound bow but it will deal increase its damage to 1d10 and its range by 15 feet. The base damage of a compound bow increases with to your STR stat as if it were a melee weapon.
- <u>Short</u>: The bow is small and very easy to draw. You reduce your base damage to 1d6 but you will not suffer penalties for shooting from a mount or in a moving vehicle. At rank IV you will gain the ability Reposition. 
- <u>Crossbow</u>: Instead of longbows you are proficient using more precise but cumbersome crossbows. A crossbow increasees its base damage to 1d10 and it will be able to ignore an additional point of your target's defense whenever you use precise shot. These weapons are also harder to reload, requiring you to spend a full-round action recharging it before being able to fire again. At rank II you gain fast reload instead of quick attack.
