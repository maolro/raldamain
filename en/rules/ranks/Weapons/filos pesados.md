## Rank I

You roll an additional proficiency die on attack rolls.

<u>Parry:</u> As a reaction you can make a save against a melee weapon attack. You roll your attack dice defensively for a parry and can cancel a success or two generated advantages once per turn (2 times per turn at rank III and 3 times per turn at rank V). Parry can only be used once per round, and going into defensive form will allow you to use it one additional time (2 additional times if you use a standard action to go into defensive form).

<u>Slash:</u> Your attacks are very effective against unarmored enemies. When dealing damage with your weapon to a target you can spend a number of perks equal to 1 + the defense value of their armor to inflict [bleed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#sangrado). Your permanent wounds increase their effectiveness by 1 against creatures wearing light armor or no armor.

## Rank II

<u>Great cleave:</u> You can spend a full turn action to attack all creatures with a 15-foot arc. this attack counts as an area attack for the purposes of evasion or when attacking marabouts, but will not deal mandatory damage. Your slash stops immediately if a creature with a shield succeeds in its defense.

<u>Power Attack:</u> You are able to trade accuracy for increased attack strength. Before attacking, you can declare your attack as a powerful attack, whereby you add one difficulty die to your attack roll but inflict +2 base damage on hit. At rank IV you can add another difficulty die to inflict 2 additional points of damage.

## Rank III

You roll an additional proficiency die on attack rolls . Spend 2 advantages to inflict a mild wound (4 perks to inflict a medium wound). 

<u>Sundering strike</u>: Hitting an armored target with your powerful attack reduces its armor defense by 1. This reduction can be removed by repairing the armor, and if the armor's defense is reduced to 0 it becomes unusable (which counts as if it were not wearing armor for the effects of Fierce Slash). This ability can be used in a normal attack by spending 2 perks.

<u>Trap blade</u>: When you attack an enemy with your sword and he uses Parry to defend himself, you can spend 2 perks to make your swords locked. If your sword is locked you have the opportunity to spend 2 perks on an attack to disarm your opponent or move 5 feet next to him (4 perks to break his weapon if it is made of a lower hardness manerial). To free his sword the opponent must roll an attack against your parry and succeed or move out of your range suffering an attack of opportunity. The opponent cannot attack you if he has his sword locked.

## Rank IV

<u>Whirlwind of steel:</u> Using Great Cut costs you a standard action. You can use a move action when making Great slash to attack all creatures adjacent to you. Using Great slash in this way counts as an area attack and will deal damage to creatures that remain adjacent to you even if they succeed in defending. This ability can still be stopped by a shield.

<u>Shieldbreaker:</u> When attacking an enemy with a shield and missing the hit, you can spend 2 perks to deal 1 damage to the shield. when the shield's damage exceeds the defense it grants it breaks instantly (for example, for a wooden shield that grants three Difficulty dice you must deal 3 damage to it for it to break). shieldbreaker does automatic damage if the shield blocks one of your powerful attacks.

## Rank V

You roll an additional hit die on attack rolls. Spend 2 perks to inflict a medium wound (4 perks to inflict a serious wound).

<u>Quick attack</u>: You can spend a move action to make one additional sword attack per turn. Your skills apply normally to this attack. You may employ Parry one additional time per turn for each move action you have.

<u>Death cleave:</u> When you hit an enemy with a Powerful Attack, you can spend 4 perks to cause a critical wound to the body part you hit. This ability costs you 2 perks if your target is wearing light armor or their armor has been disabled.

# Weapons

A base slashing blade weapon does 3+Success slashing damage and has a range of 5 feet. A cutting edge weapon can be modified with the following characteristics to result in all related weapons.

- **Heavy:** The weapon is larger than normal size, increasing its base damage by 1 at the cost of requiring two-handed use. If you have strength 6 or more you can hold a heavy weapon with one hand.
- **Light**: The weapon is smaller in size and easier to use. A light weapon reduces its base damage by 1 but you will be able to use your DEX stat for attack rolls made with it. If the weapon is a sword it will lose the attribute Powerful Attack at rank II and you will receive [sneak attack](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/filos%20perforantes.html#rango-i) (with a light axe nothing happens). For the purposes of two-weapon combat you can choose the piercing blade branch even if the weapon has a slashing blade.
- **Double**: The weapon has a second blade with which you can make attacks. When making an attack with your weapon you can declare it as a double attack, so you can make an additional attack as a bonus action but you will roll one less skill die on both attacks. When you reach rank III you will be able to apply your weapon skills to your second attack and at rank V you will have no penalty on a double attack.
- **Axe**: The weapon is an axe rather than a sword. An axe does +2 base damage on hit but you will not be able to use the Parry skill to defend against attacks made by light weapons. At rank III you receive the attribute [powerful charge](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/contundentes.html#rango-iii) instead of Clash of swords.
- **Throwing:** The weapon can be thrown a distance of 20 feet, functioning as a ranged weapon. You will roll your weapon dice for a throwing attack and the abilities Powerful Strike, Destroying Impact, and Shield Breaker will continue to apply. Throw can only be applied to light weapons.
- **Serrated:** The blade of the weapon is equipped with several small blades that cause severe wounds on impact. You automatically inflict [bleed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#sangrado) on impact to a creature wearing no armor or light armor. If the creature already has Bleed the damage your weapon inflicts will increase by 1.
- **Swordbreaker**: The weapon has several wedges on the blade with which it can break the blades of your enemies. If the enemy defends with a Parry attack against your weapon you can spend 2 generated disadvantages to reduce the weapon's base damage by 1, breaking it if you manage to reduce the base damage to 0. If a creature attempts to defend against a Power Attack using Parry you may spend 2 generated disadvantages to break your enemy's weapon. This can only be used if the base damage of the weapon is equal to 2 or less.
