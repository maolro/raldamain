## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack rolls made with chains.

<u>Entangling strike:</u> Whenever you hit a target with a chain attack instead of dealing damage you can entangle them with your chain. This effect will cause your target to become entangled and they will be incapable of movint more than 15 feet away from you. Additionally, you will be able to do push, disarm and trip maneuvers against an entangled creature as a move action. Escaping from entanglement works the same way as escaping a grapple.

<u>Chain dance</u>: By spinning your chain at high speed you are able to protect yourself from enemy attacks. By spending a move action you will enter a state of focus known as chain dance. While you remain in clain dance you are capable of defending yourself against attacks using your chain and any creature that passes throuth the area you threaten will suffer an immediate opportunity attack. The bonuses from this ability will cease if you lose focus.

## Rank II

<u>Circular sweep</u>: You can spend a full turn action to attack all creatures within a 15-foot arc. A circular sweep will stop immediately if a creature blocking with a shield succeeds in its defensive roll and you will not be able to use entangling strike with it. If you spend a charged attack you will be able to do a free trip maneuver against all creatures you hit. Using this ability costs a standard action at rank IV.

<u>Charge attack:</u> You can spend actions to spin your chains even faster, increasing the power of your attacks and defense. Every attack action you spend this way will add 1 chain charge, reaching a maximum equal to rank + 1. While you have charged attacks you will gain a bonus to all defensive rolls equal to the number of charged attacks you have. As a bonus action you can spend a charged attack to increase your attack and damage bonus by 1. All charged attacks you have will be lost if you suffer a permanent injury or a negative status effect.

## Rank III 

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20

<u>Chain grab:</u> Attempting to grapple an entangled target now costs a move action. If you have grappled a creature you can slam it against a solid surface up to 10 feet away, automatically inflicting damage equal to your weapon's base damage. Slamming a creature costs you a standard action (a move action at rank V).

<u>Deflect projectiles:</u> Chain dance can be used to protect you from ranged attacks or magical attacks with an area of effect of 10 feet or less, letting you use your weapon to defend yourself against such attacks. If you roll a critical defense or your target rolls a critical miss you can deflect the attack to target a creature of your choice up to 15 feet away. This ability can only be used while chain dance is active.

## Rank IV 

<u>Shifting chain:</u> You can adjust the range of your chains and use them to perform unexpected combat techniques. Adjusting your range costs you a move action and with it you can adjust your reach by 5 feet (once per round this ability can be used as a bonus action). If you reduce your reach to 5 ft you will gain advantage on all defense rolls, while if your reach is increased to 15 ft you will gain disadvantage in defensive rolls. When making an attack you will hit all creatures that are in a line of equal length to your range, ignoring cover other protections.

<u>Human shield:</u> You can use grappled targets as human shields, repositioning them to receive attacks made against you. If you have chain dance active you can use a grappled creature to block an attack made against you, granting you improved cover and if the attack misses you it will hit the grappled creature instead.

## Rank V

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20

<u>Hangman's noose:</u> Using a move action you can wrap your chain around a grappled or entangled creature's neck, causing them to be at risk of suffocation. A creature grabbed this way will be fatigued and if it spends more turns grappled than its CON stat it will immediately fall unconscious and die the following round. If you use this ability on a surprised creature reduce the amount it turns it can survive without falling unconscious by 1 (minimum 0). If a creature grabbed this way falls vertically it must roll STR against your attack roll or it will die instantly. This effect will repeat every round it remains in that state.

<u>Reposition:</u> Your quick footwork lets you gracefully enter and exit engagements. If you succeed in a check to parry an attack you can move 5 feet as a reaction without provoking attacks of opportunity, even if you move outside your enemy's reach. Whenever you move with reposition the creature you grapple will also move 5 ft. Additionally, making attacks with a chain now costs you a move action.

# Weapons

A base chain deals 1d6 + STR bludgeoning damage and has a reach of 10 feet. A base chain can be modified with the following traits to create to all kinds of related weapons.

- **Whip:** Instead of a chain you specialize in fighting with a whip. A whip deals 1 + STR bludgeoning damage on hit and it will not be able to inflict permanent injuries on an armored creature. Making an attack with this weapon costs you a move action instead of a standard action (at rank III you can make a whip attack once per turn as a bonus action and at rank V you can attack with it twice per turn).
- **Hook:** The weapon has a hook at its tip with which you can grapple your targets with ease. At rank I instead of entangling your target you can grab it with your hook, which will hinder its movements and inflict 1 damage whenever it takes an action. Pulling off a hook costs a move action and the creature that breaks away from it will suffer bleed. A chain with a hook inflicts piercing damage instead of bludgeoning.
- **Blunt**: The weapon has a solid sphere of stone or metal capable of shattering shields and armor when accelerated at high speeds. A chain with this enhancement must be used with two hands and whenever you spend a charge to increase its damage on a hit your target must succeed in a CON check against your weapon or become stunned. If you spend 2 or more charges you will reduce the DEF of your target's armor by 2 on hit (it it blocks with a shield reduce its defense modifier by 1).
- **Spiked**: The weapon is covered with several sharp spines capable of causing greivous harm to the creatures you grasp. A spiked chain inflics bleed on creatures you manage to grab or entangle if you manage to grab a body part in which they are not wearing armor. At rank III instead of slamming a creature with your chain you can choose to squeeze it with your chain, inflicting 1d6 + STR piercing damage and increasing the level of a permanent injury on it by one step if it is unarmored.
