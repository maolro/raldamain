Whenever an attacker hits a shield with a critical hit or you roll a critical miss the shield's defensive bonus will be reduced by 1. A shield can be modified with the following traits to create all types of shields:

- **Light:** A light shield is easier to carry and use at the cost of protecting you less. You suffer no penalty to your DEX when defending yourself with a light shield but its defensive bonus will be reduced by 1. 
- **Metallic** A metallic shield has greater resistance than a wooden one, making it capable of sustaining 2 critical hits before its defensive bonus is reduced. Shields of this type increase the penalty to DEX by 1 unless you have 4 or more STR.
- **Tower**: A tower shield is a large barrier capable of protecting your entire body from attacks at the cost of greatly reducing your mobility. A tower shield increases its defensive bonus by 2 at the cost of reducing your DEX by 1 and your movement by 10 feet.
