## Range I

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. 

<u>Attack sequence:</u> spends a move action to make an attack without additional weapon. You can substitute one of these received attacks for this ability to make a disarm, trip, steal or foul play shot. The maximum number of attacks you can do per turn is 1+R.

<Martial defense: You can use a stop as a reaction, rolling your natural attack dice defensively. Spend 2 advantages generated to make a natural attack as a reaction (it works as a sequence of attacks). If you try to use martial defense against an enemy with a weapon, he can spend advantages to make you [permanent injuries](http://raldamain.com/rules/Heridas%20permanentes.html) even if he misses the shot. One candle per turn cancels an enemy success (2/turn at range III and 3/turn at range V).

## Range II

<When hitting with a natural attack, spend 2 advantages so that your target cannot defend against your next attack (4 advantages so that he is stunned for one turn). A creature affected by Stun Fist cannot move by spending advantages.

<When hitting with a natural attack, spend 1 advantage to push the target back 5 feet. If your strength exceeds that of your target you will trip him up as well as push him.

## Range III

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. Spend 4 advantages to inflict a mild permanent wound (you inflict a medium permanent wound if you use an accurate fist).

<u>Diverting projectiles:</u> Martial defense can be used as defense against ranged attacks. You spend 2 generated handicaps to catch the projectile and 4 to deflect it against another target (You can't use this skill to deflect fast projectiles like arrows or darts). Martial defense still doesn't protect you against bullets.

<You are able to aim at the enemy's vital points, sacrificing ease of impact for the opportunity to make permanent wounds. You add a difficulty die to precise punches (2 if head, arms or crotch), but on impact you inflict a slight permanent wound on the target. At range V you can spend 2 advantages to inflict a medium permanent wound to the target.

## Range IV 

<Devastating blow: Your natural attacks can break wood and even metal. When hitting a target with armor with a natural attack, you spend 2 advantages to reduce their DEF by 1. This skill can also be used against shields if your attack is blocked by one, which will do damage to it, like the Blunt Shield Breaker skill.

<You can target the pressure points of a target to disable part of their body and even prevent them from using magic. By hitting with an accurate fist, you spend 2 advantages to temporarily paralyze the body part you hit. If it is a leg, it is tripped and its speed is reduced to half; if it is an arm it is disarmed and cannot attack with it, and if you choose the head it falls unconscious immediately.

## Range V 

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. Spend 4 advantages to inflict a medium permanent wound (you inflict a severe permanent wound if you use an accurate fist).

<Deadly Punch: If you hit the target's head with an accurate fist, you spend 4 advantages to instantly kill the target. For this skill to work on the target it must not wear armor or its defense must be reduced to 0.

<Ruthless Attack: Once a turn, perform an additional natural attack as a bonus action against a target that is stunned or unconscious. The permanent wounds made by this attack are of a higher level than you would normally inflict.
