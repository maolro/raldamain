## Range I

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with natural attacks. Increase your base damage to 1d4.

<u>Attack sequence:</u> Using natural attacks now cost you a move action and instead of attacking you can choose to do combat maneuvers, such as push, disarm, trip or grapple. You will also gain a +1 bonus to priority, which will increase again at ranks III and V.

<u>Martial defense:</u> You are capable of using your martial arts skills to parry enemy attacks, even those made by weapons. This ability works in a similar way to parry, but if you attempt to block a slashing blade weapon or one with the spikes trait you will immediately gain the bleed status effect.

## Range II

<u>Stunning fist:</u> Whenever you successfully hit with an attack you can force your target to roll CON against your attack. If you succeed they will immediately be stunned. This ability can only be used once per round and if you spend an additional move action on it your target will be staggered until your next turn even if it succeeds in its save. 

<u>Punishing kick:</u> The strength of your attacks is capable of pushing back your targets. Whenever you successfully hit with an attack your target will be pushed 10 feet back and if they have less strength than you they will immediately fall prone. This ability can be used against a target that successfully parries your attack by spending an additional move action. This ability will not work against creatures in defensive position or form.

## Range III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20

<u>Deflect projectiles:</u> You are capable of blocking high-speed projectiles with your martial arts mastery. This ability lets you use parry to defend yourself against ranged attacks not made by firearms. If you roll a critical defense or your target rolls a critical miss you can deflect the attack to target a creature of your choice up to 15 feet away. 

<u>Precise strike</u>: Through intense focus you can target your enemy's weak points, sacrificing accuracy for the chance to inflict greater damage. To do a precise strike you will gain a -2 penalty to attack rolls in exchange of increasing the level of all permanent injuries you inflict by one step. If you spend a move action to aim you can reduce the penalty of precise attacks by 2, including the penalty to target specific body parts.

## Range IV 

<u>Devastating strike:</u> Your fists are capable of breaking wood and even iron. Whenever you hit a ta

<u>Pressure point</u>: 

## Range V 

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20

<u>Deathblow</u>: 

<u>Opportunistic strike:</u>
