## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with blunt weapons.

<u>Power Attack</u>: You are able to trade accuracy for greater attack strength on your attacks. This ability allows you to declare an attack as a Power Attack, which will grant you a -2 penalty on attack rolls in exchange for inflicting +2 base damage and pushing 5 feet on hit. At rank IV you can increase the penalty by -2 to inflict 2 additional points of damage and push 5 additional feet. 

## Rank II

<u>Stunning blow:</u> Whenever you successfully hit with an attack you can force your target to roll CON against your attack. If you succeed they will immediately be stunned. This ability can only be used once per round and if you use it in a Power attack your target will become staggered for a round even if it succeeds in its CON save (creatures with the plating ability are immune to this effect).

<u>Swinging mace:</u> You can spend a full turn action to attack all creatures within a 15-foot arc. Your cleave will stop immediately if a creature blocking with a shield succeeds in its defensive roll.

## Rank III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Sundering strike:</u> Hitting an armored target with a Power Attack will reduce its DEF by 2. This reduction can be removed by repairing the armor, and if the armor's defense is reduced to 2 or less it becomes unusable. This ability allows you to make a Sunder maneuver against your target's armor as an attack, for which you use your weapon's bonus against your target's heroism  and on success you will reduce its DEF by 2.

<u>Mighty charge:</u> Whenever you hit a target with a charge it will automatically be pushed back 10 feet and you can do a free trip maneuver against it. You can do power attacks without penalties after doing a charge.

## Rank IV 

<u>Shield Breaker</u>: Your powerful attacks are capable of weakening and even shattering shields. If a creature with a Shield succeeds in parrying a Power Attack it will reduce its defensive bonus by 1. If the shield's defensive bonus reaches 0 it will be destroyed and cannot be used to protect you from attacks. 

<u>Shatter ground:</u> Using Swinging Mace now costs you a standard action. As a full turn action you can strike the ground with the force of your weapon, turning the ground within 10 feet of the impact into difficult terrain. All creatures in that area must succeed in a DEX roll against your attack or immediately fall prone and become staggered until your next round (creatures with plating are immune to this effect).

## Rank V 

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20.

<u>Ruthless Attack:</u> Once a turn you can perform an additional attack with your weapon as a bonus action against a target that is stunned or unconscious. The permanent wounds made by this attack are of a higher level than you would normally inflict.

<u>Knockout blow</u>: Whenever you damage an unarmored enemy with power attack they must succeed in a CON check against your attack or they will immediately fall unconscious. If you aim at your target's head before attacking on a hit they will fall unconscious without a save. Resist death will still apply against this ability, protecting your target from falling unconscious.

# Weapons

A base blunt weapon deals 1d8 + STR bludgeoning damage and has a reach of 5 feet. Blunt weapons are capable of inflicting permanent injuries on armored enemies even if they reduce your damage to 0. A blunt weapon can be modified with the following features to produce all types of related weapons.

- **Heavy**: The weapon is oversized, increasing its base damage to 1d10 at the cost of requiring two hands to use it. If your STR is 6 or greater you can hold a heavy weapon with one hand.
- **Light**: The weapon is smaller in size and easier to use. A light weapon reduces its base damage to 1d6 but you can use your DEX stat for attack rolls made with it. At rank II you will receive Flurry of blows instead of Swinging mace.
- **Double**: The weapon has a second tip with which you can perform attacks. Once per round when making an attack with your weapon you can declare it as a double attack, by which you can make an additional attack as a bonus action in exchange of receiving a -2 penalty on both attacks. When you reach rank III you will be able to apply your weapon attributes to your second attack and at rank V you will have no penalty on a double attack.
- **Spikes**: The weapon is covered with several sharp spikes. On hit it will deal +2 piercing damage and it will inflict bleed on targets without armor or whose DEF has been reduced to 0.
- **Throwing**: The weapon can be thrown at a distance of 20 feet, functioning as a ranged weapon. You will use your DEX stat for thrown attacks and your abilities Power Attack, Concussion, Sundering Strike and Shield Breaker will apply to them. This trait can only be applied to light weapons.
