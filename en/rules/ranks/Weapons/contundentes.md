## Range I

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. 

<Powerful attack: You are able to exchange accuracy for greater attack strength. Before attacking, you can declare your attack as a Powerful Attack by which you roll one skill die less but deal +2 base damage on impact. At range IV you can reduce your attack by one additional die to do +2 damage with your attacks. Add one Ability die to [Smash](http://raldamain.com/rules/talentos.html#lista-de-talentos) shots when using Mighty Attack.

<When hitting with a Strong Attack, you spend 1 advantage to push the target back 5 feet. If your strength exceeds that of your target, you will stumble as well as push him. Your attacks cause [permanent damage](http://raldamain.com/rules/Heridas%20permanentes.html) to armored creatures even if their DEF reduces your damage to 0.

## Range II

<On impact with an attack you spend 2 advantages so that your target cannot defend against your next attack and 4 advantages so that he is stunned for a turn. A creature affected by concussion cannot move by spending advantages.

<Use a full turn action to attack all creatures with a 15 foot bow. This attack counts as an area attack for evasion or squad attack purposes. This attack stops immediately if a shielded creature succeeds in its defense.

## Range III

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 allowances to inflict a Mild Permanent Wound (4 allowances to inflict a Medium Permanent Wound).

<Destroying Impact: When you hit an armored target with your powerful Attack, you reduce their armor defense by 1. This reduction can be eliminated by repairing the armor. This reduction can be removed by repairing the armor. In this case the armor defense is reduced to 0 and the armor is unusable (it counts as if it didn't have armor for fierce slash. This skill can be used in a normal attack by spending 2 advantages. 

<Powerful charge: When you hit a target with a charge, it is automatically pushed back 10 feet. If their strength is less than yours they will be tripped. You do not throw a penalty on Powerful Attacks if you perform them after a charge.

## Range IV 

<When you attack an enemy with a shield and fail to hit them, you can spend 2 advantages to do 1 damage to the shield. When the damage of the shield exceeds the defense that it grants, it breaks instantly (for example, for a wooden shield that grants three purple ones, you must do 3 damages for it to break).

<u>Breaking ground:</u> Using Swinging Mace costs you a standard action. As a full turn action you can hit the ground with the force of your weapon, turning the ground within 10 feet of the impact into Hard Ground. All creatures in that area must either shoot Reflexes at your weapon or stumble down. The advantages generated with this skill can be used to Slow down or Push as specified by the Shock Impact and Concussion skills.

## Range V 

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 allowances to inflict a medium permanent wound (4 allowances to inflict a severe permanent wound).

<Ruthless Attack: Once a turn, perform an additional attack with your weapon as a bonus action against a target that is stunned or unconscious. The permanent wounds made by this attack are of a higher level than you would normally inflict.

<When hitting an enemy with a powerful Attack, spend a number of advantages equal to 1+ the DEF of their armor to make them fall unconscious instantly. The Resist Death skill is applied against this skill, protecting your target from falling unconscious.

# Weapons

A base blunt weapon does 3+successful blunt damage and has a range of 5 feet. A blunt weapon can be modified with the following features to produce all types of related weapons.

- Heavy:** The weapon is oversized, increasing its base damage by 1 at the cost of requiring two hands. If you have strength 6 or more you can hold a heavy weapon with one hand.
- Light:** The weapon is smaller in size and easier to use. A light weapon reduces its base damage by 1 but you can use your DES stat for attack shots made with it. At rank II you will lose the Swinging Mace attribute but will receive an Attack Sequence.
- Double:** The weapon has a second tip with which you can perform attacks. When making an attack with your weapon you can declare it as a double attack, so you can make an additional attack as a bonus action but you will roll one skill die less in both attacks. When you reach rank III you will be able to apply your weapon skills to your second attack and at rank V you will have no penalty on a double attack.
- Spikes:** The weapon is covered with several sharp spikes. It will deal +1 piercing damage and when hitting a target without armor you can spend 2 advantages to give them Bleeding. 
- Throwing: The weapon can be thrown at a distance of 20 feet, functioning as a ranged weapon. You will roll your weapon dice for a throwing attack and continue to apply the Mighty Attack, Concussion, Destroying Hit and Shield Breaker skills. Throwing can only be applied to light weapons.
