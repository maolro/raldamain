## Rank I

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 allowances for inflicting a mild [permanent injury](http://raldamain.com/rules/Heridas%20permanentes.html) (4 allowances for inflicting a medium permanent injury).

<Your attacks ignore enemy armor as if they were touching if your target is at a distance of less than 30 feet (15 feet for a one-handed weapon). You can take a one die shooting difficulty penalty to use this skill against an enemy at a greater distance than indicated (add one additional difficulty die for each 30 foot distance increment that separates you from your target).

<Drawing your weapon costs you one movement action (free if it is a one-handed weapon). You also have +1 priority in the initiative (+2 at rank III and +3 at rank V).

## Rank II

<u>Quick Reload:</u> Reloading a weapon costs you a move action, while big weapons require a standard action (normally reloading is a standard action and reloading a big weapon is a full turn action).

<u>Bullet trick</u>: Use your advantages to do a combat trick This skill can only be used if you hit the target, and all combat tricks cost 2 advantages: 

- False fire: The target is faked during a turn, making him unable to dodge the next attack he receives. He spends an additional advantage so that the attacker receives an Advantage die on his next shot.
- Thunderbolt: The shot causes a loud bang, scaring the target away for a turn. It spends an additional advantage to make it move 5 feet in a random direction (2 to make it hit the ground).
- Lucky Shot: Destroy a small object carrying the target (potions, sheathed weapons, a side bag). If the impacted object is a bomb, it explodes on the spot. Cat 2 additional advantages to drop an object it is carrying.

## Rank III

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 allowances to inflict a medium permanent wound (4 allowances to inflict a severe permanent wound).

<Your long-range attacks ignore cover and concealment unless it is complete, thus avoiding any type of penalty (2 dice being normally a Disadvantage). Accurate shooting only works against targets in your kill radius.

<Sniper eye reduces all penalties for shooting at a distance by one Difficulty die and doubles the distance at which you can use deadly aim. All sniper eye shots require a full turn action if you do not use a weapon with the Sniper skill.

## Rank IV

Moving shot: You can move before and after shooting, distributing your total movement as you wish (15 feet before and 15 feet after for example). You are also not penalized when shooting mounted or in a moving vehicle.

## Rank V

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 advantages to inflict a serious permanent injury.

<When you hit an enemy with an attack, you spend 4 advantages to multiply your base damage by 2, automatically inflicting a serious injury if you do at least one point of damage. To use this skill you must have used expert aim in your attack.

<Your attacks are able to hit the weak point of the target. If you spend a move action to aim at a shot you can make the defender unable to use shield or magic stop on his defensive shot.

# Weapons

A base firearm does 5+successful piercing damage, has a medium range of 90 feet and requires a standard action to reload. This weapon is made for campaigns set in the Renaissance or pirate era, but also serves for more modern campaigns with the appropriate improvements. A base firearm can be modified with the following features to accommodate all types of related weapons.

- Handgun: The weapon can be used with one hand, reducing its base damage by 1 and its distance by 30 feet in exchange for greater ease of use. Handguns require only one movement action to reload and can be used in combat with two weapons.
- Chamber: The weapon has a chamber that can hold several bullets. The chamber allows the weapon to fire 6 shots before it must be reloaded. A gun with a chamber is typical of campaigns set in the industrial era or the old west. 
- Pellets: Instead of bullets, the gun will fire a shower of lead pellets. A pellet gun must have a chamber and will expend it completely with each shot, but it will be able to hit all creatures in a 15-foot cone when firing and inflict +1 base damage. 
- Double Barrel:** The weapon fires two bullets per turn with an attack at the cost of making it more difficult to use. Base damage from a double-barrel weapon increases by 2 but you will roll one skill die less on attacks made with it.
- Powerful:** A powerful weapon fires the bullets with greater power but will have great recoil strength. A powerful weapon deals +1 base damage but can only be used by characters with FUE 2 or more. If the weapon is two-handed the user must have FUE 3 or more or will receive a one die disadvantage penalty on all their shots.
- Automatic:** The weapon has a system to shoot bullets automatically. Making an attack automatically costs you a standard action and you will be able to attack every creature in a 30 foot cone, starting with the closest one. These attacks will consume 4 bullets but will deal +2 base damage and you will stop making automatic attacks when you need to reload. Weapons with this ability will have a 40 bullet chamber and are typical of campaigns set in modern or science fiction times.
- Sniper:** The weapon can shoot at targets at a greater distance and kill them with a single bullet. As a standard action you can aim your gun, increasing your range to a maximum of 200 feet. In this state you will receive the Sneak Attack skill and can use Deadly Aim if you make a surprise attack against your target. Weapons in this category are typical of modern or science fiction campaigns.
