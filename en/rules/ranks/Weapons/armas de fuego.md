## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack rolls made with firearms.

<u>Deadly aim:</u> Your attacks are especially deadly when striking enemies at close range. When attacking a target within 30 feet of you you will ignore any defense they have for natural and manufactured armor (this is 15 feet for a handgun) and any permanent wounds you cause will increase their effectiveness by one step. Before making an attack you can add a -2 penalty to your attack roll to increase the distance at which you can use deadly marksmanship by 15 feet.

<u>Gunslinger's Agility:</u> Drawing your weapon costs you a move action (this costs you a bonus action if it is a handgun). You also your initiative by 1, and increase it again when you reach rank III and V.

## Rank II

<u>Quick reload:</u> Reloading a weapon costs you a move action, while reloading large weapons require a standard action. You can use a move action to make an additional attack with your weapon.

<u>Bullet Trick:</u> Your expert marksmanship allows you to use your attacks in an unexpected way to weaken your opponent's defenses. Instead of attacking you can use your gun to perform one of the following effects on an enemy:

- **False Shot:** Your target must defend himself by figuring out intentions. If it fails it will be incapable of dodging your next attack as if it was a feint.
- **Thundering shot:** The shot causes a thunderous boom, causing your target to become disoriented. It must defend itself by making a Constitution roll, and on failure it must move 10 feet in a random direction and is Shaken until its next turn.
- **Lucky Shot:** Your target must defend itself using Dodge. If it fails it will drop a small object it is carrying on its body, such as a potion, a bomb or a side bag. If the object is particularly fragile it will be destroyed by your bullet.

## Rank III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Precise shot</u>: Your attacks have become much more precise, allowing you to ignore any obstacle that provides neither cover nor complete concealment. When attacking a target affected by deadly marksmanship it will lose all defensive bonuses granted by cover and concealment. This ability will not work as already specified against enemies with cover or full concealment.

<u>Sniper's Eye</u>: By carefully aiming your attacks you are able to fire deadly shots at even more distant enemies. You can use a move action to increase your deadly aim radius by 15 feet without taking a penalty. In addition, you can add your dexterity stat to your damage rolls against targets unable to defend themselves.

## Rank IV

<u>Shot on the run</u>: You can move before and after shooting, distributing your total movement as you wish (15 feet before and 15 feet after, for example). You will also suffer no penalties when shooting mounted or in a moving vehicle.

<u>Rain of lead</u>: Once per round you can use a bonus action to make an additional attack with your weapon. This ability can also be used to provide cover fire to an ally of your choice, allowing you to make a defensive roll using your attack modifiers to protect them. 

## Rank V

Increases your critical hit chance to 18-20.

<u>Vital Strike</u>: By striking an enemy unable to defend itself with deadly aim you are able to deal it a lethal blow. An attack made this way will multiply your base damage by 2 and inflict a severe permanent wound when it damages your target.

<u>Expert marksmanship</u>: Your attacks are able to hit the target's weak points. By using a move action to aim a shot you can make the defender unable to use shield or magic to block your attack. This ability will not work against characters that are in a defensive stance (it also does not work against those in defensive form).â€ƒ

# Weapons

A base firearm does 5+success piercing damage, has a medium range of 90 feet and requires a standard action to reload. Drawing a weapon of this size will cost you a standard action (move action if it is a handgun). This weapon is made for campaigns set in the Renaissance or pirate era, but also serves for more modern campaigns with the appropriate improvements. A base firearm can be modified with the following features to accommodate all types of related weapons.

- **Handgun**: The weapon can be used with one hand, reducing its base damage by 1 and its distance by 30 feet in exchange for greater ease of use. Handguns require only one movement action to reload and can be used in combat with two weapons.
- **Chamber**: The weapon has a chamber that can hold several bullets. The chamber allows the weapon to fire 6 shots before it must be reloaded. A gun with a chamber is typical of campaigns set in the industrial era or the old west. 
- **Shotgun**: Instead of bullets, the gun will fire a shower of lead pellets. A pellet gun must have a chamber and will expend it completely with each shot, but it will be able to hit all creatures in a 15-foot cone when firing and inflict +1 base damage. 
- **Double Barrel**: The weapon fires two bullets per turn with an attack at the cost of making it more difficult to use. Base damage from a double-barrel weapon increases by 2 but you will add one difficulty die on attacks made with it.
- **Potent**: A potent weapon fires the bullets with greater power but will have great recoil strength. A potent weapon deals +1 base damage but can only be used by characters with STR 2 or more. The recoil also makes future shots less accurate, adding a setback die to all future attacks on the same round after attacking (this effect is cumulative).
- **Automatic**: The weapon has a system to shoot bullets automatically. Making an attack automatically costs you a standard action and you will be able to attack every creature in a 30 foot cone, starting with the nearest one. These attacks will consume 4 bullets each but they  will deal +2 base damage. Weapons with this ability will have a 40 bullet chamber and are typical of campaigns set in modern times or science fiction.
- **Sniper**: The weapon can shoot at targets at a greater distance and kill them with a single bullet. As a standard action you can aim your gun, increasing your range to a maximum of 200 feet. In this state you will deal +2 damage and can use Deadly Aim if you make a surprise attack against your target. Weapons in this category are typical of modern or science fiction campaigns.
