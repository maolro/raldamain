## Range I

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots.

<When hitting with a chain attack, you spend 2 advantages to grab a part of the target. A creature caught in this way is not able to get more than 15 feet away from you and all creatures get one Advantage die in attacks against it. You can use 1 generated Advantage or Disadvantage to push the grabbed creature 5 feet or 2 Disadvantages to trip it up (disarm it if you grab it by one arm).

<Chain dance: By turning your chain at high speed you are able to protect yourself from your enemies. By spending a movement action to enter a defensive position, every time a creature tries to enter the area you threaten it will suffer an immediate attack of opportunity, stopping it immediately on impact with it. You can use Stop with your chains only if you are in a defensive position, but you will not receive any bonus on the shot unless you spend a standard action to enter defensively. Once a turn you can cancel a success that generates an enemy in an attack (twice a turn at range III and three times a turn at range V).

## Range II

<As a full turn action you can attack all creatures in a 15 foot arc. You cannot use entanglement in a circle attack and it can be stopped in the same way as cutting (i.e. on impact with a shield). Chain Dance is activated during a turn when performing a Circular Attack

<When you use your standard Chain Dance action, the chains will spin faster, increasing the damage they inflict. Each standard action you spend in this manner will add one Advantage die to your next attack shot and increase base damage by 1, reaching a maximum of +3 damage. You will lose all your loaded attacks if you suffer permanent damage or lose concentration.

## Range III 

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 allowances to inflict a [mild permanent injury](http://raldamain.com/rules/Heridas%20permanentes.html) (4 allowances to inflict a medium permanent injury).

<Chain Grabbing: Grabbing targets that are tangled in your chains costs you a move action or the expense of 2 advantages. You can move up to 10 feet in any direction to a clinging creature or force it to a surface. Stamping a creature is a Heroic shot that will inflict 1+Successful blunt damage. Using any of these skills costs you one movement action.

<Reflecting Projectiles: Chain Dance can be used to protect you from ranged attacks or magical attacks with an area of effect of 10 feet or less. This skill works as the attribute with the same name of martial arts. This action can only be used if you have Chain Dance active.

## Range IV 

<You can adjust the range of your chains and use them to perform amazing combat techniques. Adjusting the range costs you a usable bonus action once a turn and alters your range by 5 feet. You will roll one less difficulty die on stop shots if your range is 15 feet or more. Increasing or decreasing the range again costs you a move action, reaching a maximum of 15 feet. When making an attack you will damage all creatures that are in a line of equal length to your range, ignoring cover and protections.

<You can use creatures held by you as human shields, repositioning them to receive attacks made on you. When spending disadvantages in moving a creature, if you move it in the middle of a ranged or magical attack it will suffer the damage without being able to shoot defensively. You can also use this skill to protect yourself from melee attacks, but to do so the creature must be moved to the exact position of your attacker.

## Range V

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 allowances to inflict a medium permanent wound (4 allowances to inflict a severe permanent wound).

<By successfully grabbing a child, you can use 2 advantages or a movement action to grab the child's neck, leaving it at risk of drowning. If a child spends more turns grabbing than its NOC, it will fall unconscious. If you strangle a creature with a surprise attack the number of turns it can take before falling unconscious is reduced by 1 (minimum 0). If a creature grabbed in this manner suffers a fall it must throw WITH against your attack shot or it will instantly die by hanging.

<Reposition: You receive the Reposition light-edged skill as if you were rank III. By using Reposition you will also move 5 feet to the creature you are holding.

# Weapons

A base chain does 2+Success slashing damage and has a range of 10 feet. A base chain can be modified with the following characteristics to give rise to all kinds of related weapons.

- **Whip:** Instead of a chain you specialize in fighting with a whip. A whip deals 1+Success blunt damage on hit and its permanent wounds will be one level lower, but making an attack with it costs you a move action (at rank III you can make a whip attack once per turn as a bonus action).
- **Hook:** The weapon has a hook at its tip with which you can grapple more easily. At rank I instead of entangling your target you can hook it, which will hinder its movements and cause damage when it grapples against it. A creature with a grappling hook attached cannot be separated from your chain and will suffer 2 non-lethal damage each time it takes an action. Pulling off a hook costs a move action and will cause [bleed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#sangrado) to the creature that breaks away from it. A chain with a hook inflicts piercing damage instead of slashing.
- **Blunt**: The weapon has a solid sphere of stone or metal capable of shattering shields and armor when accelerated with appropriate speed. When employing the Charge Attack skill with a weapon that has this enhancement you may spend 2 perks generated on impact to [stun](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#aturdida) your target. If your chain is fully charged you can use the [shield breaker](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/contundentes.html#rango-iv) or [destructive hit](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/contundentes.html#rango-iii) skill by spending the appropriate amount of perks. A chain with this enhancement must be used with two hands and will inflict 2+Success blunt damage on impact.
- **Spiked**: The weapon is coated with several sharp spines that cause devastating slashes to the victims you grasp. A sawed chain inflicts the effects of [bleed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#sangrado) on creatures you manage to grab or entangle (for this to apply you must grab a creature at a point where it is not wearing armor). At rank III instead of slamming a creature with your candena you can choose to squeeze it harder to increase the severity of the cuts, which allows you to inflict 1+Successful slashing damage and spend a number of perks equal to the defense it receives for armor to cause it to bleed.
