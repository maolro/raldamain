# Ranks

## Range I 

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots.

<u>Deadly aim</u>: When shooting at a target that is less than 15 feet away from you you will ignore all the defense points it receives for its armor. Damage resistances and additional defense provided by Armored Aptitude will continue to apply, but you will ignore natural armor with this ability. You can take a penalty of one Difficulty die to use this skill against a target up to 30 feet away. The maximum distance at which you can use Deadly Sight increases by 5 feet each time you receive an additional range of Bows.

<u>Sneak Attack:</u> Your attacks target the weaknesses of the enemy. You do +2 damage in surprise attacks or attacking targets unable to dodge. Before attacking, you can target a specific part of the target by receiving a difficulty die as a penalty (add two difficulty dice if you choose the Head) in exchange for inflicting a slight permanent wound on that part of the body on impact with your attack. At range III you inflict a medium wound and at range V a severe wound using Stealth Attack in this manner. If you generate advantages in a sneak attack and you are aiming at a specific part of the target's body you can spend 4 advantages to increase the level of the permanent wound by 1. You can only affect enemies that are in your kill zone with a sneak attack.

## Range II

<u>Expert Archer:</u> Use your advantages to do a combat trick. This skill can only be used if you hit the target. All skills cost 2 advantages: 

- **False shot**: The target is faked during a turn, making him unable to dodge the next attack he receives. It spends an additional advantage for the attacker to add one advantage die to his next shot.
- **Disarming shot**: The target is Disarmed, dropping his weapon. He spends an additional advantage to have the enemy move 5 feet in a random direction.
- **Lucky shot:** Destroy a small object carrying the target (potions, sheathed weapons, a side bag). If the hit object is a bomb, it will explode on the spot. Cat 2 Additional advantages to drop an object it is carrying.

<u>Quick attack:</u> Making an attack with your weapon now costs you a movement action. Once per round as a reaction you can spend 2 disadvantages generated to make an attack of opportunity with your weapon.

## Range III 

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 allowances to inflict a mild permanent injury (4 allowances to inflict a medium permanent injury).

<Your ranged attacks ignore the cover and concealment your targets have, avoiding the disadvantages they will provide. Accurate shooting only works against targets in your kill radius that are not in full cover or concealment.

<Sniper's Eye: Reduce all penalties for shooting from a distance by one Difficulty die. Sneak attack is applied against targets located at any distance from you. 

## Range IV

<Moving shot:</u> You can move before and after shooting, distributing your total movement as you wish. You also don't suffer penalties when shooting mounted or in a moving vehicle.

<Agile Archer: You are able to change accuracy to speed to shoot a shower of arrows. When making an attack you can declare it as a rapid attack. A fast attack costs you a bonus action to perform but this and all attacks you make after it will reduce the number of skill dice you roll by 1. You cannot perform more than one fast attack per turn.

## Range V

You roll an additional loosening die on attack shots. You spend 2 allowances to inflict a medium permanent wound (4 allowances to inflict a severe permanent wound).

<When you hit an enemy with an attack, you spend 4 advantages to multiply your base damage by 2 (automatically inflicting a serious injury if you do at least one point of damage). To use this skill you must have used expert marksmanship in your attack.

<Your attacks are able to hit the weak point of the target. If you spend a move action to aim at a shot you can make the defender unable to use shield or magic stop on his defensive shot

# Weapons

A base bow does 3+ Success piercing damage and has a range of 60 feet. You can shoot enemies at a maximum of 90 feet by receiving a single die difficulty penalty. A base bow can be modified with the following features to produce all types of related weapons.

- Composite: The bow requires great strength to be drawn but will increase the speed of the projectiles. You need to have FUE 2 or more to use a compound bow but it will deal +1 base damage and increase its range by 10 feet. The base damage of a compound bow increases according to your FUE stat as if it were a melee weapon.
- Short: The bow is small and very easy to draw. You reduce your base damage by 1 but will not suffer penalties for shooting mounted or in a moving vehicle. You won't receive penalties for fast attacks with the Agile Archer skill.
