## Range I

<u>Skill with two weapons:</u> As a bonus action once a turn you can make an attack with your secondary weapon with a penalty of one skill die. This penalty disappears when you reach rank III.

<Combat style: You get a number of attributes depending on the weapon you carry in your secondary hand. Every time you raise your rank with two weapons you receive the attributes listed in the skill list.

## Heavy Edges

### Range I

<Double stop: You can use stop once in addition to your turn with your secondary weapon (you still get the penalty). Also, the ability to cancel a success can be used once in addition to the turn (a third time at rank III).

<When hitting the same target with your two weapons in the same turn, your second attack deals +2 base damage. This skill can only be used once per turn.

### Range II

<When you use the Big Cut action you can also attack with your secondary weapon. You will shoot one less green on the cut but you will affect a 5 foot radius centered on you. This attack can only be stopped if a shielded character succeeds in his defense twice.

<You can spend 2 advantages to disarm an opponent without the need to be on locked swords. Your opponent cannot use Stop to defend himself from your secondary weapon when he has the locked sword.

### Range III

<You do +2 base damage using steel whirlwind and deal 1 additional automatic damage to each shield you hit with this ability. When you spend one movement action on slice in sequence you do an additional attack with your secondary weapon (1/turn).

## Light Blades

### Range I

<Divert Attacks: Your secondary weapon can divert attacks that break through your defenses. Once a turn you can make a second stop against an attack that successfully hits you using your secondary weapon. You cannot cancel successes with this skill.

<Sneak Fighting: You apply the precise attack damage to your second weapon whenever you roll a dice for an attack advantage with it. This skill is also applied against dummy enemies. You lose the benefits of Stealth Fighting if you are unarmed from your main weapon.

### Rank II

<Catching a weapon: using your two weapons you can catch swords bigger than yours. You can use the Clash of Swords skill by spending 2 advantages (see Heavy Edges), with which you can disarm heavy edge weapons. You can't fake if you have your weapon locked unless you have the Dummy skill

<Targeted attacks: You can make targeted attacks with your secondary weapon as if it were your primary weapon. You are not penalized for making a targeted attack with your secondary weapon if your target is faked.

### Range III

<As a standard action, make an attack with your two weapons on a specific point of your opponent's body. When using this skill you can't make attacks with your secondary weapon or use fast attacks, but you will increase the base damage of your attack by 2. If you use Slash against an enemy who is surprised you can spend 2 advantages to use the Vital Strike skill (normally it costs 4 advantages).

## Chains

### Range I

<You are able to use Chain Dance with your secondary weapon if you do not attack with it. This way entering in a defensive position costs you a bonus action. By using a standard action to enter defensively you will do +2 damage in opportunity attacks against creatures that enter the area you are threatening. 

<Whirlwind attack: Using a whirlwind attack costs you a standard action. You can use a full turn action to attack all creatures within your range. Chain dance is activated by using this skill, and Whirlwind attack can be stopped in the same way as circle attack.

### Range II

<If you get the same target tangled up in your two chains, it is automatically grabbed without you having to use a moving action. Moving or stamping a grabbed creature costs you a bonus action the first time you do it, and to escape your grip the creature must succeed in two rolls against your chains. You cannot use spinning chains or charge attack while holding a creature.

<You can use the Reflect Projectiles skill as long as the Spinning Chains effect is active. You still can't reflect high speed projectiles, although once a turn you can cancel a success generated by an enemy attack (2/turn if you have range III in chains and 3/turn if you have range V)

### Range III

<Instead of attacking with your two chains you can make them revolve around you at high speeds, allowing you to load an attack with each of your chains and immediately activate the Chain Dance skill. If you damage the same target with your two attacks, their armor suffers damage equal to the number of turns you have been charging your chains (maximum 3 damage). If the target has 0 armor it increases the effectiveness of your permanent wounds by 1.

## Firearms

### Range I

<Weakening defenses: You can use your shot with the secondary weapon to expose the enemy to other shots. When hitting an enemy with a shot you can choose not to hurt them so that they suffer a bullet trick. Your target's resistances are applied for this attack, but you can use them to give additional effects related to the bullet trick. 

<You are able to shoot point-blank with your secondary weapon to protect you from attacks. By using this skill you will receive one additional Difficulty die on all your attack shots, but you will be able to roll your Firearms dice defensively to protect you from melee and ranged attacks. Using cover fire consumes one additional bullet per turn.

### Range II

<u>Lead rain:</u> No penalties when using point-blank shooting. As a full turn action you can make an area attack against all creatures in a 30 foot cone or a 15 foot radius. You will roll one Difficulty die as a penalty in the area attack and spend the charges of both guns.

<Predicting movement: You have a supernatural instinct for danger. You receive the Amazing Dodge skill (Improved Amazing Dodge if you already have it) and can spend 2 Disadvantages generated to make an attack with your secondary weapon as a reaction. Deadly aim is applied for this attack.

### Range III

<When you attack a creature that has suffered damage at some point during the round you add +2 base damage to your firearm attacks. Reloading your secondary weapon costs you one move action and you don't need to have a free hand for it.
