- Evaporate a quantity of water with a maximum volume of one square foot adjacent to you.
- Move an amount of water of volume equal to one square foot in a direction of your choice. The water you manipulate will not harm or push.

## Rank II

Increase your CON by 1.

<u>Skilled Swimmer:</u> You receive a swim speed of 30 feet. Being underwater does not impair your vision and you automatically succeed on rolls to swim in strong currents (they will still impair your movement). You suffer no non-lethal damage from swimming for an excessive amount of time.

<u>Water breathing</u>: Your lungs are better adapted to breathing underwater. You are able to hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your rank and you cannot be drowned by elemental waer magic

<u>Hydraulic push:</u> As a bonus action you can suffer 2 non-lethal damage to infuse your attacks with your element. An infused attack will deal +1 base damage and you will gain advantage in combat maneuvers. If you have ranks in Ice Magic you can make your natural attacks deal +2 cold damage and stagger your targets whenever you inflict a permanent injury.

## Rank III 

Increase your resistance to physical damage by 2.

<u>Fluid form:</u> As a standard action you can surround yourself with a barrier of fluid waters, protecting yourself from physical and magical attacks. While this barrier remains active all damage you suffer will be reduced by 2 and a 10-foot area centered on you becomes difficult terrain. You can suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of the currents, increasing the damage reduction by 2 for one round and granting you advantage in defensive rolls. To use this ability you must be in contact with 5 or more cubic feet of water and it cannot remain active for more than one minute at a time.

<u>Elemental connection:</u> Water is a source of life for your body. When you start your turn in contact with water or submerged in it you regain 1 Vitality. You will not be able to heal your HP in this way, but by taking a short rest in an area with a high presence of your element (rivers, lakes, seas or rain) you recover all your HP as if you were taking a long rest. If you use water in a First Aid check you will not consume a use of this ability and you will heal 1 additional HP.

## Rank IV 

Increases your CAR by 1.

<u>Water column:</u> You are able to walk through water without suffering penalties to your movement. As a standard action you can propel yourself with a column of water, which grants you a flight speed equal to 30 feet but you cannot rise higher than 45 feet. Each turn you hold the column you suffer 2 non-lethal damage unless you spend a move action. Column of water can only be used if you are in contact with a surface area equal to or greater than the distance you intend to rise. Column of water can be used as a move action if you choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage.

<u>Infused attacks:</u> Your attacks are water-shifting, shifting nimbly from attack to defense. You receive the ability to Reposition, allowing you to move 5 feet as a bonus action upon successfully parrying an attack (you move an additional 5 feet if you already have this ability). In addition, you can spend 2 perks generated with a natural attack to Feint your target. If you have ranks in Ice Magic your attacks inflict +1 base damage.

## Rank V 

You gain Resistance 3 to physical damage and Magic Resistance equal to your Rank - 2.

<u>Element of change:</u> Your defenses are adaptable to the situation you are in. You receive Resistance to Fire and Acid damage equal to your Rank. In addition, at the beginning of your turn you can gain Resistance against a status effect of your choice (Slowed, Sickened, Confused, Dazed, or Fatigued) equal to your Rank.

<u>Echolocation:</u> You have blind sight in a 30-foot area. You can also predict the movements of creatures that are on the same water surface as you, preventing you from being surprised if you are in the water and allowing you to repeat an attack or defense roll once per turn.

## Rank VI

Increases your DES by 1.

<u>Elemental Form:</u> As a full turn action, you are surrounded by a large mass of roaring water. While in elemental form you are constantly surrounded by a Wall of Water and using Water Column costs you a move action (holding is a bonus action). The defense granted by Fluid Form increases by 2 and cannot be destroyed except by a Firestorm or the attack of a creature in Fire Elemental Form. All water within 30 feet centered on you is under the effect of Roaring Currents (see Water magic). Each turn you maintain elemental form you suffer 1 Vitality damage and lose the Elemental Connection ability. Elemental form fades if you lose concentration or suffer a lava attack.
