## Rank I

You gain resistance 2 to physical damage and unlock ranks in [elemental earth magic](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/ranks/Elemental%20magic/earth%20magic.html)

<u>Landbound:</u> You develop a strong bond with a region, acting as its guardian if it is ever in danger. A region is a territory up to 20 km in area covered mainly by land.  As long as you remain in contact with land of your region you regenerate 1 vitality every round and gain advantage in all rolls (your bonded region also counts as favored terrain for the purposes of [Track](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/ranks/Combat/track.html), but advantage from both effects will not stack). To declare a territory as your region you must spend a day exploring and meditating on it. You can only have one region linked in this way.

<u>Geokinesis:</u> Your elemental heritage allows you to control the earth. As a bonus action you can manipulate a small amount of earth or sense the earth's characteristics. You can only use one of these effects per turn.

- Move 1 square foot of earthen material 30 feet in any direction. The earth you manipulate will not hurt or push. 
- Make a complete analysis of all earthen and metallic objects in a 10 square foot area, detecting secrets and anomalies in them.

## Rank II

Increase your CON by 1.

<u>Earthen Fists:</u> As a bonus action, you can suffer 2 nonlethal damage to infuse your natural attacks with earth for one turn. Infused attacks do +2 base damage and will gain the Stunning fist and Punishing kick abilities (if you already have them you will gain advantage on push, trip and grab combat maneuvers). If you have ranks in [natural weapons](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/ranks/Weapons/natural%20attacks.html) increase the level of [permanent wounds](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/main%20rules/permanent%20injuries.html) you inflict by one step. You do not suffer non-lethal damage with this ability if you are in your bonded region.

<u>Earthwalk:</u> You can shape the earth to move across it unimpeded. Ignore all penalties from difficult terrain and increase your burrow and climb speeds by 15 feet.

<u>Georadar:</u> You gain blindsight within 30 feet, allowing you to detect all creatures that are in contact with the earth. You also receive advantage on insight checks against creatures that are touching the ground. You can spend a standard action to increase the radius of your georadar by 15 feet.

## Rank III 

Increase your resistance to physical damage by 1.

<u>Stone armor:</u> As a standard action you can surround yourself with armor made of solid stone. Stone armor will increase your DEF by 2 and grant you a number of temporary hit points equal to 1 + rank. This armor disappears when your temporary hit points are reduced to 0 or you lose concentration.

<u>Elemental connection:</u> The power of the earth heals your wounds and strengthens you on the battlefield. When you start your turn by touching solid ground you recover 1 Vitality. You cannot heal your HP in this way, but by taking a short rest in an area in your bonded region you will recover all your HP as if you were taking a long rest. At rank V every time you begin your turn touching solid ground you will heal 1 HP or 2 Vitality.

## Rank IV

Increases your STR by 1. You can replace the attack bonus you have in a specific weapon with your elemental magic bonus.

<u>Earth Wave:</u> Your burrow and climb speeds increase by 15 feet. As a standard action you can manipulate the earth to form a massive wave beneath your feet. The wave moves you 60 feet per turn and all creatures in its path must roll dexterity against your elemental magic or suffer 1d8 + CHA bludgeoning damage, get pushed 10 feet and fall prone. To maintain this ability you must spend a move action or take 2 non-lethal damage. Earth wave can be used as a move action if you are in your linked region.

<u>Infused Attacks:</u> Your physical attacks increase their base damage by 2 and are coated with solid stones, counting as adamantine for the purposes of determining what materials they can break (if you have [Devastating strike](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/ranks/Weapons/natural%20attacks.html#range-iv) you can use this ability on all infused attacks). If you use earthen fists on an infused attack you gain the ability to reduce your target's DEF by 2 on hit. 

## Rank V

Increase your resistance to physical damage by 1 and your magic resistance by 3.

<u>Element of balance:</u> Your constitution is rock solid, granting resistance against thunder, necrotic, fire, and cold damage equal to your rank. You also increase your maximum HP by a value equal to your rank - 2.

<u>Predictive georadar:</u> The radius of your georadar increases by 30 feet. You are able to predict the movements of other creatures touching the ground, allowing you to reroll an attack or defense roll once per turn and making you immune to surprise attacks. Your initiative also increases by 2 if you are in your linked region.

## Rank VI

Increases your WIS by 1.

<u>Elemental Form:</u> As a full turn action you can surround yourself with a large mass of earth. While you remain in Elemental Form increases DEF and temporary HP from stone armor by 2. You can also use Earth wave as a move action and increase your base size by one step, increasing your CON and STR by 2 and decreasing your DEX by 1. In addition, whenver you strike the surface of the ground with a natural attack turns you will turn all area within a 5-foot radius into difficult terrain. Elemental form will last a number of rounds equal to your rank + 1 or until you lose concentration on it. This ability will also be lost if you lose contact with the earth, either by falling or by being swept upwards.

<u>Chosen of the spirits:</u> You have become a champion blessed by the spirits themselves. Their blessings grant you resistance 4 to mind-effects, poisons and diseases, and you body ages ten times slower. Spirits will never be naturally hostile against you and they will treat you with great respect.
