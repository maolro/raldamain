## Rank I

You gain Resistance 1 to physical damage. 

<u>Landbound:</u> You develop a stronghold with a region, acting as its guardian in case of danger. A region is a territory up to 20 km in area, equivalent to a hexagon on the Raldamain map. As long as you remain in contact with the land of your region you have regeneration 1 and add an advantage die to all your rolls (it also counts as [favored terrain](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Combate/rastrear.html#rango-i) for the purposes of Tracking). To declare a territory as your region you must spend a day exploring and meditating on it. You can only have one region linked in this way.

<u>Geokinesis:</u> Your elemental heritage allows you to control the earth. You unlock the ranks of [earth elemental magic](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20tierra.html). As a bonus action you can manipulate a small amount of earth or sense earth's characteristics. You can only use one of these effects per turn.

- Move 30 feet in any direction an amount of earth equal in volume to one square foot. The earth you manipulate will not hurt or push. 
- Make a complete analysis of all earthen and metallic objects in a 10 square foot area, detecting secrets and anomalies in them.

## Rank II

Increase your CON by 1.

<u>Earth Fists:</u> As a bonus action, you may suffer 2 nonlethal damage to infuse your natural attacks with earth for one turn. Infused attacks do +2 base damage and you can spend 2 generated perks to [slow](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#ralentizada) the target for one turn (4 perks to [stun](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#aturdida)). If you have ranks in Martial Arts, you increase the level of permanent wounds you inflict by 1. You do not suffer non-lethal damage with this ability if you are in your linked region.

<u>Earthwalk:</u> You can shape the earth to move across it. You ignore difficult terrain and have a digging and climbing speed of 15 feet.

<u>Georradar:</u> You gain blind sight within 30 feet, but you can only detect creatures that are in contact with the earth. You roll an additional hit die on intent-spotting rolls against creatures that are touching the ground. You can spend a standard action to increase the radius of your georadar by 15 feet.

## Rank III 

You gain Resistance 2 to physical damage. 

<u>Stone armor:</u> As a standard action, you surround yourself with solid armor made of stones. That armor increases your DEF by 2 and grants you a number of temporary health points equal to 1+your ascendancy rank. This armor disappears when your temporary health points are reduced to 0 or you lose concentration.

<u>Elemental connection:</u> Earth heals your wounds and strengthens you on the battlefield. When you start your turn by touching the earth you regenerate 1 vitality. When you take a short rest in contact with the earth you reduce the level of a permanent wound by 1 (reduces the level of all your wounds if it is a long rest). When you reach rank V of this ascendancy you increase the number of Vitality you heal per turn by 1 and you will recover 2 HP per turn if your Vitality is at maximum.

## Rank IV 

Increases your STR by 1. You may roll any hit dice you possess in elemental magic instead of those you possess in physical attacks on attack rolls.

<u>Earth Wave:</u> Your Dig and Climb speed increases to 30 feet. As a standard action you can manipulate the earth to form a huge wave beneath your feet. The wave moves you 60 feet per turn and all creatures in your path must roll dexterity against your elemental magic roll or suffer 1+success blunt damage and be pushed 10 feet (spend 1 advantage to trip an enemy or push them an additional 5 feet). You suffer 2 non-lethal damage each turn you hold ground wave unless you spend a move action. Ground wave can be used as a move action if you are in your linked Region.

<u>Infused Attacks:</u> Your physical attacks increase their base damage by 1 and are coated with solid stones, counting as if they were made of Adamantine for toughness purposes. Upon hitting an armored creature you can spend 2 generated perks to automatically reduce its defense by 1 (this ability is automatically activated if you have the [devastating blow](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/artes%20marciales.html#rango-iv) skill). You can add any looseness dice you have for elemental attack to any weapon attack roll, replacing the looseness dice you would then roll.

## Rank V

You gain Resistance 3 to physical damage and Magic Resistance equal to your Rank - 2.

<u>Element of balance:</u> Your constitution is rock solid. You gain resistance against [poisons](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/venenos_enfermedades.html#venenos), fire, acid, and cold equal to your Rank. You increase your base HP by 1 for every 3 levels you have. This increase in HP stacks with the attributes of [fortitude](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Combate/fortitud.html).

<u>Predictive georadar:</u> The radius of your georadar increases by 30 feet. You cannot be surprised by creatures that are touching the ground and are able to predict their movements, allowing you to reroll an attack or defense roll once per turn and preventing them from catching you by surprise. Your [priority](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/prioridad.html) also increases by 2 if you are in your linked region.

## Rank VI

Increases your WIS by 1.

<u>Elemental Form:</u> As a full turn action, you surround yourself with a large mass of earth. While in Elemental Form the Stone Armor ability increases the DEF and temporary HP it grants by 2. You may also use the Earth Wave ability as a move action and add an additional looseness die to your elemental attacks. In addition, hitting a land surface with a natural attack turns the entire land within 10 feet into difficult terrain. Elemental Form ends immediately if you spend a turn suspended in midair or are incapacitated. Each turn you maintain elemental form you suffer 1 non-lethal damage and lose the Elemental Connection ability.
