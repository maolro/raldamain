As long as you remain in contact with land of your region you regenerate 1 vitality every round and gain advantage in all rolls (your bonded region also counts as favored terrain for the purposes of Track, but advantage from both effects will not stack). To declare a territory as your region you must spend a day exploring and meditating on it. You can only have one region linked in this way.

The wave moves you 60 feet per turn and all creatures in your path must roll dexterity against your elemental magic or suffer 1d8 blundgeoning damage and be pushed 10 feet (spend 1 advantage to trip an enemy or push them an additional 5 feet). To maintain this ability you must spend a move action or take 2 non-lethal damage. Earth wave can be used as a move action if you are in your linked region.

<u>Infused Attacks:</u> Your physical attacks increase their base damage by 1 and are coated with solid stones, counting as if they were made of Adamantine for toughness purposes.

<u>Predictive georadar:</u> The radius of your georadar increases by 30 feet. You cannot be surprised by creatures that are touching the ground and are able to predict their movements, allowing you to reroll an attack or defense roll once per turn and preventing them from catching you by surprise. Your initiative also increases by 2 if you are in your linked region.
