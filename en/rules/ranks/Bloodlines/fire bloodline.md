## Rank I 

You gain resistance 2 to physical damage and unlock ranks in [elemental fire magic](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/ranks/Elemental%20magic/fire%20magic.html)

<u>Heat Adaptation:</u> You are immune to extreme heat and high temperatures. You have fire resistance equal to your Fire bloodline rank.

<u>Pyrokinesis:</u> Your elemental heritage allows you to control fire. As a bonus action you can create a small flame that will last as long as you maintain concentration. You can only use this ability if you are in contact with oxygen and the flame can be used to do one of the following effects (you can only have a single effect active per turn).

- Give off light in a 20-foot area, increasing the light level of that area by one step. The light is distinguishable at a distance of 40 feet in magical darkness.
- Ignite a fire in a 5-foot area filled with flammable materials. Each space with fire will extend 5 feet in one direction if flammable material is present and will do 1 fire damage to creatures in contact with it. If the fire comes to occupy a space of 30 feet it will become a wildfire.

## Rank II

Increases your DEX by 1.

<u>Fire's fury:</u> As a bonus action you can suffer 2 non-lethal damage to infuse your weapons with elemental fire for one round. Fire infused weapons will deal +2 fire damage and inflict [mild burns](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/main%20rules/status%20effects.html#burned) whenever they deal hit point damage (medium burns on a critical hit). 

<u>Fiery impulse:</u> Fire propels you to move faster, granting you an additional move action per turn. Your jump also speeds increase, letting you jump an additional 10 feet horizontally and 5 feet vertically. 

<u>Flame sight:</u> You are able to see through flames and smoke as if they were transparent. You detect the position of all creatures within 100 feet with fire bloodline or a burn status effect of any level.

## Rank III 

Increase your resistance to physical damage by 1.

<u>Scorching aura:</u> As a standard action you can give off an aura of intense heat in a 30-foot radius. All creatures without fire resistances that begin their turn in a scorching aura will suffer 1 fire damage and all burns you inflict against them with attacks will increase by 1 step. When a creature hits you with a natural attack they will automatically suffer a mild burn unless they have resistance to fire. You may suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of the flames for one turn, granting you Immunity to fire and cold resistance equal to your rank as well as inflicting a mild burn to all creatures in the area wearing metal armor.

<u>Elemental connection:</u> Fire heals your wounds and allows you to recover spent energy. When you start your turn in an area that is on fire or extreme heat you recover 1 Vitality. You cannot heal your HP in this way, but by taking a short rest in an area with a high presence of your element (deserts, volcanoes or places affected by extreme heat) you recover all your HP as if you were taking a long rest. At rank V every round you remain in an area affected by fire or extreme heat you will heal 1 HP or 2 Vitality.

## Rank IV

Increases your CHA by 1. You can replace the attack bonus you have in a specific weapon with your elemental magic bonus.

<u>Fire jet:</u> You are able to propel yourself into the air with your fire magic. As a standard action you can fly 60 feet in any direction ignoring opportunity attacks. This ability can be used as a move action if you choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage.

<u>Infused weapons:</u> Your attacks are infused with the power of a raging fire. All physical attacks you make will deal +2 fire damage and inflict a mild burn whenever they deal hit point damage (this damage stacks with fire's fury). Once per round you can do an additional natural attack as a bonus action.

## Rank V

Increase your resistance to physical damage by 1 and your magic resistance by 3.

<u>Element of power:</u> Your connection to elemental fire propels yourself at superhuman speeds. You will suffer no damage if you succeed on a dexterity check and you gain advantage on all dodge rolls. If you already have the attribute evasion extend the maximum radius of area attacks you can dodge with this ability by 15 feet.

<u>Thermal vision:</u>  You gain thermal vision in a 30-foot range which allows you to detect the position of heat-emitting creatures. Thermal vision does not work on undead and constructs and enabling or disabling thermal vision costs a bonus action. 

## Rank VI 

Increase your DEX by 1.

<u>Elemental form:</u> As a full turn action, you surround yourself with pure elemental fire. While in elemental form you are constantly surrounded by a Wall of fire and the damage from scorching aura will increase by 1. In this state you can use fire jet as a move action without suffering non-lethal damage. In addition, all attacks you make will deal fire instead of physical damage and use your CHA stat for attack and damage modifiers. Elemental form will last a number of rounds equal to your rank + 1 or until you lose concentration on it. This ability will also be lost if you are submerged in water or are affected by a [tsunami](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/ranks/Elemental%20magic/water%20magic.html#rank-v) or [hurricane](https://raldamain.com/en/rules/ranks/Elemental%20magic/air%20magic.html#rank-v).

<u>Chosen of the spirits:</u> You have become a champion blessed by the spirits themselves. Their blessings grant you resistance 4 to mind-effects, poisons and diseases, and you body ages ten times slower. Spirits will never be naturally hostile against you and they will treat you with great respect.
