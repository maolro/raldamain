## Rank I

You gain resistance 1 to physical damage. 

<u>Cold Adaptation:</u> You suffer no ill effects from being in an area of extreme cold and have resistance to cold damage equal to your rank. You are especially vulnerable to fire damage, which deals +2 damage against you.

<u>Icy touch:</u> Your touch is supernaturally cold. You unlock [ice magic](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20hielo.html) and can freeze 5 feet of water as a bonus action once per turn. When you hit a metal object with your ice elemental attack, it becomes supernaturally cold. An object thus chilled does 1 cold damage to its wearer per turn until it warms up.

## Rank II

Increases your CON by 1.

<u>Ice Walker:</u> You suffer no penalties when walking on ice and may choose to leave no footprints as you pass. You have the ability to walk on water, freezing it as you pass. You cannot walk on water in the event of a storm or roaring waters.

<u>Channel Cold</u>: You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to infuse your attacks with ice. An infused attack does +2 ice damage and you can spend 2 perks to slow your target. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your rank + 2.

<u>Arctic Vision</u>: Snowstorms and fog do not hinder your vision, allowing you to see everything within 60 feet. This ability does not work with smoke or gases that hinder vision.

## Rank III 

You gain Resistance 2 to physical damage. 

<u>Snowy mantle:</u> The cold polar winds bend to your will, freezing those unfortunate enough to approach you. You unlock [air elementalism](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20aire.html) but without access to its sub-branches and lose vulnerability to fire, instead gaining resistance equal to your rank -2. As a bonus action, you can activate an aura of icy winds of radius 15 feet. The aura gives you 2 dice disadvantage on defense rolls against ranged attacks and 2 dice advantage on stealth rolls. All creatures without cold damage resistances suffer 2 non-lethal damage per turn as long as they remain in the area. The aura will remain active as long as you maintain concentration and cannot be employed if you are not in a cold environment.

<u>Absorb Cold:</u> When you start your turn in an area affected by a snowstorm or in extreme cold (snowy blanket does not apply to this effect), you heal 1 non-lethal damage. If you are at maximum vitality you will be healed 1 HP. When you take a short rest in extreme cold, reduce the level of a permanent wound by 1 (reduce all your permanent wounds if you take a long rest). When you reach rank V of this ascendancy increase the number of Vitality you heal per turn by 1 and you will recover 2 HP per turn if your Vitality is at maximum.

## Rank IV

Increases your DES by 1.

<u>Windwalker:</u> You gain a flight speed of 60 feet, but you can only fly if you are in a storm. If you attempt to fly in another environment, you suffer 2 non-lethal damage to be able to fly 60 feet. Attacking a person from the air does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

<u>Infused attacks:</u> Your physical attacks do +1 cold damage and count as magical attacks. This damage stacks with channel cold and you can spend 2 generated perks to slow the target (use 4 perks to reduce their DES by 1). You can add any looseness dice you have for elemental attack to any [martial arts](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/artes%20marciales.html) roll, substituting for the looseness dice you would then roll.

## Rank V 

You gain Resistance 3 to physical damage and Magic Resistance equal to your Rank - 2. 

<u>Gaseous Form:</u> If you are in a snowstorm, spend a standard action to infuse yourself with it, going into gaseous form. In gaseous form you are immune to physical damage, move at a flight speed of 60 feet, and cannot physically attack. You can still make elemental attacks, but each turn you maintain gaseous form you must spend a move action to concentrate or suffer 2 non-lethal damage (absorb cold does not apply). If the storm disappears, you immediately return to your standard form and are stunned for one turn.

<u>Life Sense:</u> You are able to detect all warm-blooded living creatures within 60 feet, thus preventing your enemies from receiving any advantage from surprise attack or invisibility. You can also identify all people with boreal ancestry within that radius.

## Rank VI

Increases your CAR by 1

<u>Child of Winter:</u> You become a primordial creature of winter. You are immune to [fatigued](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#fatigada), [exhausted](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#exhausta), [slowed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#ralentizada) and [paralyzed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#paralizada) status effects. Your life expectancy is doubled and you can spend a full turn action to enter elemental form, similar to other elemental ascents. Like these, you may add an additional casting die to your elemental attacks while in elemental form. Entering elemental form can only be used once per combat and each turn you maintain it you will suffer 1 non-lethal damage (Absorb Cold does not apply). When activating elemental form you have two options to choose from:

- **Icy Colossus:** You surround yourself with powerful ice armor. Your size increases to large, you receive 8 temporary HP, increase your natural armor by 2 and increase your strength to 6 (8 if you are in an area of extreme cold). Because of your large size your dexterity is reduced by 1 and you will not be able to fly.
- **Living Storm:** You are surrounded by a snowstorm with a radius of 15 feet. This storm gives you concealment and will deal 2 non-lethal cold damage to all creatures that start their turn in it, stacking with Snowy Mantle. You may use Gas Form and Windwalker in this area and the damage of all your elemental attacks made within your storm area will be increased by 2.
