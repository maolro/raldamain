## Rank I

Add a proificiency die to rolls related to space magic. Your reserve is increased by 2+Rank chi.

<u>Dimensional Leap:</u> As a move action you can teleport 30 feet in any direction.  With this ability you can move in and out of areas threatened by other creatures without provoking attacks of opportunity. This ability consumes 1 chi from your reserve and can also be used as a reaction to automatically dodge an attack (for this you must maintain concentration during your turn). 

<u>Minor Portal:</u> You are able to create small holes in space that connect two locations at most 30 feet apart as a standard action. These portals are one foot in diameter and through them you can manipulate objects at that distance. You can also make attacks through the portals, so you would attack as if you were in the position of the portal (ignoring cover or other effects). A minor portal lasts one turn unless you spend a chi from your reserve to extend its duration one more turn. You can have a maximum of 1+Rank minor portal open. At rank III creating a minor portal costs you a move action. 

## Rank II

<u>Dimensio door:</u> Use one chi from your reserve to create a 5-foot spatial portal. This gate connects the location where you create it to another visible location at most 90 feet away. The gate, like the minor portal, only remains active for one turn and continuing to maintain it costs you one chi from your reserve. A dimensional gate counts as a minor portal for the purposes of determining how many portals you can keep open.

<u>Dimensional Anchor:</u> As a standard action make a space magic attack roll against a target. If you hit it cannot use space magic abilities for 1+Successful turns or pass through a portal. You can use two perks from that shot to close an open portal within 10 feet of the impact zone. The target cannot protect itself from Dimensional Anchor by using Dimensional Leap. Dimensional Anchor can also be used to close all portals within 5 feet, for which you do not need to make an attack roll. This ability consumes 1 chi from your reserve.

## Rank III

Add a proficiency die to rolls related to space magic.

<u>Redirect Attack:</u> As a reaction you can create a minor portal to redirect a physical or magical ranged attack. For this ability you make a defensive shot of space magic, and if the target misses their attack it will fall through the portal and continue its trajectory through the place where you opened it. If there is a creature in that path then you can make an attack against it using your space magic shot and with base damage equal to the damage of the magic attack. Use 2 generated perks to make the redirected attack count as a surprise attack. You cannot use Dimensional Leap to dodge if you use this ability and Redirect Attack counts as an open portal for minor portal purposes (you will not be able to close all open portals with Redirect Attack until your next turn). Roll a disadvantage die on defensive shots with this ability for each open portal within 10 ft. (15 ft. at V range).

<u>Connecting gateway:</u> Instead of connecting two points in space you can connect multiple portals with one. Thus, when you make a magical attack that passes through such a portal it will emerge from each of your connected portals, allowing you to make multiple attacks per turn. You cannot connect more than three portals to a single portal. Your space alteration also increases the strength of your magical attacks, causing each time a magical attack passes through a portal it will increase its base damage by 1. The attack can pass through multiple portals per turn if they are in the middle of its path, but you cannot alter the path of the attack so that it passes through all of your portals. 

## Rank IV

<u>Dimensional Lock</u>: You are able to create a 20-foot radius barrier centered on you that prevents space alterations and teleportation. Activating a Dimensional Lockdown costs you a standard action and consumes 2 chi from your reserve, and remains active each turn as long as you maintain concentration. Dimensional Lock can be overridden with Remove Superior Magic and is deactivated when entering an anti-magic zone. This ability can be bound to a specific location using Glyph of Protection, which causes an entire 40-foot area centered on the glyph to prevent teleportation and space alterations. 

<u>Teleport</u>: You have knowledge of the chi conduits that construct reality, and can manipulate them to teleport great distances. As a full turn action you create a portal that connects you to a location anywhere in the world. To do this you must make a space magic roll against a difficulty roll decided by the master depending on your familiarity with the location you seek to visit. If you succeed you will appear at the designated location, while failures cause you to end up at a location other than it. Disadvantages and advantages reduce or increase the accuracy of the portal. One use of this ability consumes 2 chi from your reserve and you can also transport up to four allies with you.

## V Rank 

Add a proficiency die to rolls related to space magic.

<u>Gate:</u> You can perform a two-turn ritual to open a gigantic portal to distant dimensions. That portal is 20 feet in diameter and leads to anywhere in the world you know (applies as teleport) or to the Spirit, Shadow, or Dream plane. The threshold will remain open as long as you maintain concentration on it, but if it is open for an extended time a creature native to the place where you have opened it can pass through it (master's decision). You can also perform rituals of longer duration (a short rest or a long rest) to open a portal to other planets or dimensions. Threshold can only be used once a day.

<u>Spaital master:</u> Minor portals you create increase in size to 5 feet in diameter, making it possible for a creature to pass through them. In addition, once per turn you can create a minor portal as a bonus action. When an enemy creature passes through one of your portals you can close it instantly, causing the creature to roll dexterity against your space magic dice or lose the body part it has entered through it (it is a random part if it tries to pass through a portal of size 5 feet). In order to close a portal in this way you must use a move action (2 advantages if you push a creature into position of a portal).
