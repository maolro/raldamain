At rank III the impact radius increases by 5 feet (by 10 feet at rank V) as you spend 1 chi to infuse the attack.

<u>Infuse Weapon:</u> You can spend 1 chi from your reserve to infuse your weapon with magical energy. Your weapon will inflict +2 energy damage on attacks for a number of turns equal to your Rank. While infused your weapon counts as a magic weapon for the purpose of piercing resistances. You can spend 1 additional chi on this ability to have the energy damage it inflicts increased by 1 (maximum +5 damage). 

<u>Energy wall:</u> As a standard action create a wall of energy 20+Rx5 feet long and Rx5 feet high. This wall will have the properties of an elemental wall of your choice, but you cannot have two walls made of different elements active....

### Rank III

Roll an additional casting die on magic attack rolls. Increase your base damage by 1.

<u>Chi Storm:</u> As a full-turn action that consumes 2 chi from your reserve, overcharge a 20-foot radius centered on you with pure energy. While the chi storm remains active, you receive partial cover against magical and ranged attacks (+2 disadvantage dice) and your attacks do +1 base damage. When a creature without Magic Resistance starts its turn in the Chi Storm area it will suffer 1 mandatory energy damage,Chi Storm remains active until you lose concentration or 1 minute passes.

<u>Overcharge:</u> Instead of attacking you can contain the chi to release it in a devastating attack. Each attack you store up grants you one energy point. When making a magical attack, you can spend a number of energy points to increase the strength of the attack. Each energy point spent increases your base damage by 1 and your splash radius by 5 feet. If you lose concentration while holding stored energy it will be released in a devastating explosion. The explosion does force damage to all creatures in a radius equal to 5 x energy points equal to 2 + the number of energy points you have stored. You also suffer non-lethal damage equal to 2 + the number of energy points from this explosion.

## Rank IV

<u>Shatter defenses:</u> Your attacks can drain the target's magical energy, weakening their defenses and making them more vulnerable to your magical attacks. When you hit a magically armored target with an evocation magic attack, you can spend 2 perks to reduce their magic armor by 1. You can spend chi on Protective Magic abilities you have such as Remove Magic or Disrupt when hitting with an evocation attack.

<u>Elemental Aspect</u>: You have the ability to channel the power of the elements into your magical attacks. You can make elemental attacks of any kind with evocation magic. These attacks function as if they were Rank I with respect to the options for spending perks and the radius they affect, but the base damage equals the damage of your evocation attacks. Damage done with one of these elemental attacks does not pass through resistances. You can also spend 1 chi to use the Energy Reserve ability of the element associated with your attack without taking non-lethal damage.

Creatures that are not wearing armor or have it reduced to 0 will die instantly, and Fortitude abilities cannot be used to prevent such effects.

<u>Superior Concentration:</u> You are able to maintain concentration on an additional effect per turn without taking non-lethal damage. Your mind is also able to stay focused in the face of great distractions, causing you to not lose concentration when suffering Sickened, Fatigued, Bleeding, and Frightened status effects (you still lose concentration when Dazed, Confused, or Panicked).
