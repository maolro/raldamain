## Rank I

Roll an additional casting die on temporary magic rolls. Your reserve increases by 2+Rank chi.

<u>Premonition:</u> Your connection to the time stream causes you to receive visions of future times, preparing you for impending dangers. You have a number of premonition charges equal to 1+Rank, which you regain after one day. As a bonus action you can spend a charge of premonition to add one Advantage or Disadvantage die to one of your rolls or receive the Amazing Dodge ability for one turn. You can spend 1 chi from your reserve to regain a premonition charge (this only works if you are in combat).

<u>Time Alteration:</u> As a standard action you can spend 1 chi from your reserve to alter time into a bubble 5 feet in diameter. With this ability you can restore objects in the bubble to their previous state (fixing them and removing all damage) or to a future state (reducing their effectiveness by 1). You cannot affect organic beings with this ability, and at Rank III Temporal Alteration costs you a move action.

## Rank II

<u>Displacement:</u> Your control over time allows you to be out of sync with it, being able to make small temporal leaps to avoid attacks. You can roll your temporary magic dice in defensive rolls to protect yourself from physical and magical attacks made against you. By spending 1 chi from your reserve as a reaction you can make a temporary jump, which allows you to reroll your defensive roll against a successful attack. Displacement does not work against creatures that also have ranks in temporal magic.

<u>Accelerate:</u> As a standard action that consumes 1 chi you can cause a creature to be able to move and act with increased speed. A creature affected by Accelerate will receive an additional move action per turn and increase its DES by 1, but each turn that Accelerate remains active it will suffer 1 non-lethal damage. Accelerate counters and is countered by Encourage.

<u>Encourage:</u> You can slow time in a 20-foot radius bubble as a standard action that consumes 1 chi, slowing all creatures in it. A creature affected by Encourage loses a move action and reduces its DES by 1. Magic and ranged attacks that pass through an Encourage bubble are also slowed, which grants two Disadvantage dice on defense rolls against them. An Encourage bubble remains until you lose concentration and counteracts all Accelerate effects within its radius. 

## Rank III

Roll an additional looseness die on temporary magic rolls. 

<u>Vision:</u> By performing a ten-minute ritual you can have a vision of a past, present, or future event. Vision can only be used once a day and its effects vary depending on what type of vision you wish to have. In all cases the nature of the vision is chosen by the master.

- **Past**: Your vision consists of an important event that has occurred in the place where you are or has affected an object in your possession. The vision can be from any historical moment, but it is recommended that it be associated with the campaign in some way.
- **Present**: Your vision allows you to observe what a person of your choice is doing at this moment. You must have in your possession an object belonging to the person you wish to observe for this effect to work. Vision does not work if the creature is in a place protected by a Secret Cache or an Anti-Magic Zone, and you can only observe your target for ten minutes at a time.
- **Future**: Your vision shows you a future event that will occur within a week. The master chooses what you can observe and can be as cryptic as he wishes to avoid a disembowelment. 

Excessive use of this ability may result in mental illness or insanity as decided by the master.

<u>Predict Movement:</u> You can spend charges of Premonition you have to receive a vision of what action a target will take, protecting you against it or getting through its defenses. Predict Movement allows you to reroll an attack or defense roll you have made with an added Advantage die. This ability can also be used to know what actions a group of creatures of your choice will take. If you choose a player he must answer you truthfully as to what he will do and will not be able to change his actions unless he also has Predict Movement and spends a Premonition charge.
