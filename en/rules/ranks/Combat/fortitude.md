You are able to remain conscious while at 0 HP, allowing you to fight to the brink of death for a number of turns equal to your rank + CON. However, in this state you will be Fatigued and unable to perform full-round actions.

<u>Natural armor:</u> Your body is capable of resisting weapon attacks., granting you natural armor equal to your fortitude rank x 2. Natural armor will reduce weapon damage you suffer, but will not count as armor for the purposes of slashing blades and weapons that deal piercing damage can inflict permanent injuries if you have 0 Vitality even it reduces their damage to 0.

## Rank II

<u>Resist Death:</u> Once per combat as a reaction to being reduced to 0 HP or less you can revive to 1 HP without suffering permanent wounds. This ability cannot be used if you are exhausted, incapacitated or suffering from nausea.
