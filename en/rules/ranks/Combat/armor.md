## Rank I

<u>Armor training</u>: Reduces the armor penalty by 2 If you manage to reduce the armor penalty to 0, you can move and use reflexes skills as if you were not wearing armor. Every time you get a range in armor proficiency reduce the penalty by 1 again

<u>Reinforced defense</u>: Increase your defense by 1 if you are wearing armor. The defense is increased again by 1 each time you get a rank in suitability with armor. This increase in defense also reduces the damage from non-magical attacks against which your armor is not applied, such as Deadly Sight.

## Rank II

<u>Superior plating</u>: Blunt attacks can only make you permanently wounded if they influence you to do damage. You have resistance equal to your range against stun and slow down caused by non-magical attacks.

<u>Elemental protection</u>: By spending a month of work and searching for the right materials you can make your armor protect you against a certain element. You get resistance equal to your range the armor against the element of your choice and the effects of states produced by it (icy touch if you choose ice, warm up armor if you choose fire, etc.). This accumulates with other resistances you have.

## Rank III

<u>Magic defense</u>: Your armor acts as an extension of your body and is infused with your magical power. The armor increases your Magic Resistance by 3 if you have a Template or ranks in a magic. If you don't have any of those ranks then you must spend a month getting special materials to make magic armor, which gives you magic resistance equal to your armor rank.

<u>Steel Champion</u>: Armor protects you from even deadly attacks. Once a turn, reduce the level of a [permanent injury](http://raldamain.com/rules/Heridas%20permanentes.html) you suffer by 1. Instant death attacks as a master hunter or life impact only cause you a serious permanent injury (you cannot reduce it again)

# Types of armor

Armor is an indispensable item for every warrior, marking in many cases the fine line between life and death. Armor will grant a bonus to defense according to the hardness and protection it offers, which accumulates with the natural armor. A character with armor cannot suffer permanent wounds if the damage is reduced to 0, a fact that does not occur with resistance or natural armor. However, heavier armor hinders dexterous movement and concentration, reducing all dexterity rolls, arcane magic, or elemental magic by a value equal to the penalty. Additionally, a character possessing an armor penalty will lose the effects of all attributes related to Reflexes. The most common types of armor are listed in the following table:

| Type                           | Defense modifier | Armor penalty |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Leather, hide, padded          | 2                | 0             |
| Studded leather, chain shirt   | 4                | 2             |
| Splint, chainmail, breastplate | 6                | 4             |
| Plate, brigandine              | 8                | 6             |
