## Rank I

<u>Rage:</u> As a bonus action you can enter a state of superior ferocity known as rage. While in the rage state you increase two physical stats of your choice by 1 and receive resistance equal to your rank against mental and morale effects. Rage will last a number of rounds equal to your rank + CON (without rage bonuses) and as long as you maintain this effect you cannot use abilities that require patience and concentration, attacking each turn if possible. Your rage will end automatically when there are no enemies in sight or you fall unconscious, becoming fatigued once you exit it. You cannot enter rage while you are fatigued unless you are reduced to less than half your HP.

<u>Fast Movement:</u> When you enter rage state you are capable of moving at even greater speeds. Your base speed increases by 10 and you are able to defend yourself against surprise attacks (the attacker will receive advantage on the attack roll and sneak attack damage will apply as normal). Your speed increases again by 5 feet when you reach rank III. If you have other types of movement that depend on your base speed (swimming, flying...) these will increase in the same way.

## Rank II

<u>Damage reduction:</u> By entering rage you survive injuries with ease. Increase your resistance to weapons by 2 and while you are in rage you will ignore the effects of all permanent injuries you take (Permanent injuries ignored this way will become effective again once you leave rage). Whenever you gain a new rank in Rage your resistance to damage will increase again by 1.

<u>Decisive Strike:</u> Once per rage you can concentrate all your forces into a single attack. Decisive Strike is a bonus action and grants you a +2 bonus and +2 damage on that attack. All bonuses increase by 2 each time you receive an additional rank in rage.

## Rank III

You receive +1 HP when you enter rage.

<u>Tireless wrath:</u> Your body is capable of withstanding exertion to superhuman limits. You are immune to poison, sickness and nausea while you are in rage. You enter rage even if you are fatigued, but you fall unconscious after that Rage ends.

<u>Unbreakable will:</u> Rage frees your instincts from the shackles of reason, prompting you to attack without fear of death. You are immune to fear and morale effects while in rage. You can use presence abilities while in rage, for which you receive advantage in all rolls to frighten other creatures.

## Rank IV

Increase your base damage by 1 when entering rage.

<u>Primal rage:</u> Your Rage takes your body to an higher level of power. Whenever you enter rage you will additionally increase all physical stats by 1 and you can overcome your body's limit, allowing them to reach a maximum of 9 (12 if you are level 12 or higher).

<u>Hard to kill:</u> You can keep fighting even if you are at 0 HP, fighting even though you push your body to the limit. When you enter this state you activate rage automatically and every turn you remain in it you will suffer 1 damage. Additionally, you will not be able to take full-round actions and all permanent injuries you have will be temporarily nullified. If your HP at the end of the rage exceeds your negative CON, you will die instantly.
