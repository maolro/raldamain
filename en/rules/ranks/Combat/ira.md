## Rank I

<u>Rage:</u> As a bonus action you can enter a state of superior ferocity known as rage. While in the rage state you increase your FUE and CON by 1 and receive resistance equal to your rank against mental and morale effects. You suffer 1 non-lethal damage each turn you spend in rage and as long as you maintain this effect you cannot use abilities that require patience and concentration, attacking each turn if possible. You cannot go into rage in case you are [fatigued](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#fatigada). Your rage ends automatically when there are no enemies nearby or you fall unconscious.

<u>Fast Movement:</u> When you enter the Wrath state you move with higher than normal speeds. Your base speed increases by 10 and you are able to defend against surprise attacks when entering Wrath (the attacker will still receive an Advantage die on the attack roll and [sneak attack](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/filos%20perforantes.html#rango-i) damage will apply as normal). Your speed increases again by 5 feet when you reach rank III. If you have other types of movement that depend on your base speed (swimming, flying...) these will increase in the same way.

## Rank II

<u>Damage reduction:</u> By entering rage you are able to sustain injuries more easily. Reduces the physical damage you take while in Wrath by 1. This reduction does not protect you from permanent wounds and increases by 1 each time you take two additional ranks of Wrath.

<u>Decisive Strike:</u> Once per rage you can concentrate all your forces into a single attack. Decisive Strike is a bonus action and grants you one Advantage die and +1 damage on that attack. The number of Advantage dice and damage increase by 1 each time you receive an additional rank in rage.

## Rank III

You receive +1 additional HP upon entering rage.

<u>Tireless wrath:</u> Your body is able to withstand exertion to superhuman limits. You are immune to [poison](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/venenos_enfermedades.html#venenos), [sickness](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/venenos_enfermedades.html#enfermedades) and [nausea](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#n%C3%A1useas) while in rage. You can go into rage even if you are [fatigued](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#fatigada), but you fall unconscious when this Rage ends, which lasts for a number of turns equal to your rank + your constitution.

<u>Unbreakable will:</u> Rage frees your instincts from the shackles of reason, prompting you to attack without fear of death. You are immune to fear and morale effects while in rage. You can use [presence](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Social/presencia.html) abilities while in Wrath, for which you receive in addition a bonus of one Ability die. 

## Rank IV

Increases your base damage by 1 when entering rage.

<u>Primal rage:</u> Your Rage takes your body to a higher level of strength. You can exceed the 6 limit on your stats, maxing out at 9. In addition, rage increases all your stats additionally by 1.

<u>Hard to kill:</u> You can keep fighting even if you are at 0 HP, fighting until you push your body to the limit. In this state you activate rage effects automatically and suffer 1 non-lethal damage each time you perform an action (2 non-lethal damage if you perform a full turn action). You only fall to the brink of death when your negative HP are equal to your constitution. If your HP at the end of the rage exceeds your negative CON, you will die instantly.
