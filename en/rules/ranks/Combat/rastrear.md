## Rank I

You receive an additional talent level in Survival.

<u>Favored Enemy:</u> Choose a species or race of your choice. You will roll an additional bonus die on skill, defense and attack rolls related to your favored enemy, plus deal +1 base damage with your attacks. If your enemy is a humanoid race, you must spend a turn studying it to gain the benefits of favored enemy against it. 

<u>Favored terrain:</u> You are an expert guide in certain terrain. Choose a terrain among forest, desert, prairie, arctic, mountain, subway and urban. As long as you are in your preferred terrain, you cannot get lost and leave no tracks unless you wish to. You also receive one Advantage die on all your skill and attack rolls, and one Disadvantage die on defensive rolls. When you reach Rank III and V you may choose an additional favored terrain in which to gain your benefits or you may add an additional Advantage die to [Perception](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#percepci%C3%B3n-sab), [Survival](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#supervivencia-sab) and [Stealth](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#sigilo-des) rolls in a favored terrain you already know.

## Rank II

<u>Expert Tracker:</u> You are able to find out information about your prey just by watching their trail. This ability allows you to use perception to ascertain the position of invisible or cloaked creatures by rolling against their [stealth](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#sigilo-des). This requires you to spend a move action and allows you to make your next attack against that target by rolling one less Disadvantage die. Each additional action spent will reduce the number of Disadvantage dice by 1, reaching at least 0.  You can also spend a short rest at a location looking for clues to events that have occurred there, which will allow you to get an idea of the events that occurred there in an interval of at most 2 hours.

<u>Stalker:</u> You move with great stealth while tracking. As a standard action you can hide in such a way that you cannot be seen by Perception rolls, effectively counting as being invisible. To use this ability you must be out of sight of enemy creatures. You can move at half speed or spend actions to study your prey while maintaining the effects of Stalk, but these will be lost the moment you attack or perform a particularly noisy action. Creatures with the Skilled Tracker ability can locate you even if you are hidden. Stalk can only be used if you are in one of your favored terrains.

## Rank III

You receive an additional talent level in [survival](https://raldamain.com/eng/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#survival-sab). Add an additional bonus die by attacking your favored enemy.

<u>Quarry:</u> As a move action you can designate a target as your quarry, immediately making it your favored enemy. You automatically succeed at tracking your prey while it is not in its favored terrain, and the permanent wounds you inflict on it will be one level higher. You can only have a maximum of one prey per day, and if it dies or escapes you cannot use this ability again for the rest of the day.

<u>Fast Tracker:</u> You are able to move with your normal speed when tracking or stalking. In addition, declaring a target as a Favored Enemy now costs you a standard action and once per turn you can employ the skill Expert Tracker as a bonus action.

## Rank IV

<u>Camouflage:</u> You can use Stalk on your preferred terrain even if you are in your victim's field of view, and you can spend 2 advantage or disadvantage generated in an attack to hide. In addition, you are able to use Stalk by spending a move action and you do not need to be in your favored terrain to use this ability.

<u>Terrain Master:</u> You know the land like the back of your hand. You receive immunity to difficult terrain and automatically avoid obstacles if you are on your preferred terrain. You will get one of the following skills depending on the preferred terrain you have chosen. If you have more than one preferred terrain you can only have one of the following skills active:

- **Arctic**: You receive resistance to cold damage equal to your Tracking Rank. You suffer no negative effects from extreme cold and have [arctic vision](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Ascendencias/ascendencia%20boreal.html#rango-ii) within 60 feet.
- **Desert**: You receive resistance to fire and necrotic damage equal to your Tracking Rank. You suffer no ill effects from extreme heat and can survive an additional day without eating or drinking. 
- **Mountain**: Increases your Climb speed by 30 feet (cannot exceed your base movement). You suffer no negative effects from extreme cold or high altitudes.
- **Underground**: Increases your Climbing speed by 15 feet (cannot exceed your base movement). You receive Poison Resistance equal to your Crawl range and have darkvision within 60 feet.
- **Aquatic**: Increases your Swim speed by 30 feet (cannot exceed your base movement). You can hold your breath for two additional turns.
- **Urban**: Increases your jump speed by 10 feet. You are able to hide in crowds of people, which allows you to use Stalk even if you are in your prey's field of vision as long as you are surrounded by people.
- **Forest:** You receive Resistance to nature magic equal to your Crawl rank. Increases your Climb speed by 15 feet (cannot exceed your base speed) and animals are not naturally hostile towards you.

## Rank V 

You receive an additional talent level in Survival. Your attacks against your favorite enemy do +1 damage.

<u>Master hunter:</u> The first strike you make is the most deadly. The damage of your attacks increases by 2 during the first round, which is increased by [sneak attack](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/filos%20perforantes.html#rango-i). When you make a sneak attack against your favorite enemy you can spend 4 generated perks to kill him instantly if he has 7 health or less. 

<u>Unstoppable Predator:</u> Choosing a creature as prey now costs you a bonus action and you add an additional looseness die on attack and ability rolls against it, plus a Defiance die on defensive rolls. The prey ability now recharges with a short rest.
