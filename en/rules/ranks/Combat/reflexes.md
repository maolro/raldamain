## Rank I

Add your Reflex rank to all defensive dodge rolls.

<u>Quickness</u>: You receive an additional move action on your turn. Additionally, you gain advantage on all your Dodge rolls to avoid attacks made by creatures larger than you. 

<u>Finesse</u>: The light weapons you carry are hard to detect and capable of killing before your enemy realizes it. Drawing a light weapon costs you a bonus action and whenever you make an attack you can make a stealth check against your opponents' perception so your attack makes no noise. If you make this attack from a concealed position you can hide again as a bonus action if you succeed in this roll.

## Rank II

<u>Evasion</u>: You do not suffer mandatory damage from area attacks that have a radius of effect of smaller than 20 feet. In addition, when an enemy misses your attack you may move 5 feet as a reaction without provoking attacks of opportunity (this increases to 10 feet at rank IV).

<u>Uncanny dodge:</u> You capable of reacting to danger before your senses warn you. You are also able to dodge surprise attacks and invisible attackers, although they will still gain advantage and receive damage bonuses from sneak attack. Uncanny dodge does not work against feints.

## Rank III

<u>Acrobatics</u>: You receive a climb speed equal to your normal speed. You are able to walk on narrow surfaces and difficult terrain without any penalties.

<u>Haste</u>: You are capable of inflicting multiple attacks on an enemy before he can react. This ability grants you a second standard action per round which you can use any of your abilities.

## Rank IV

<u>Superior Evasion:</u> Your evasive abilities allow you to escape unharmed from devastating explosions. Whenever you make a defensive dodge roll against an area attack with a radius of less than 30 feet, you take no damage if you succeed and half damage if you fail. If you are in a defensive position you will increase the radius of area attacks you can avoid with evasion by 15 feet for each action you spend.

<u>Superior Awesome Dodge:</u> You are immune to flanking and feints made by creatures with less dexterity than you. Sneak attack damage bonus will not apply against you unless the attacker has equal or higher dexterity than you. Sneak attack damage will still apply if you are incapacitated or stunned.

## Rank V

<u>Freedom of movement:</u> You gain resistance equal to your dexterity against grapple and other effects that attempt to restrain you. You will not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving out of a creature's range.

<u>Opportunist:</u> Once per turn you can make an attack of opportunity against a creature that has been hit by an attack made by an ally. This attack of opportunity counts as flanking for sneak attack purposes.
