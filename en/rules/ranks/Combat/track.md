## Rank I

Add your rank in this skill to all survival, perception and insight checks.

<u>Studied strike:</u> You are capable of learning your target's moves, skills and weaknesses through careful observation. If you spend a full-round action watching a target of your choice you will gain advantage on all rolls related to it and a 1d6 bonus to all damage rolls. Studied strike will only work against one target and to switch you must spend another full-round action.

<u>Favored terrain:</u> You are an expert guide in a certain terrain. Choose a terrain among forest, desert, arctic, mountain, underground and urban. As long as you are in your preferred terrain, you cannot get lost and leave no tracks unless you wish to. While you are in your favored terrain you will gain a +1 bonus in all skill, attack and defense rolls (to qualify for this bonus a skill roll must directly be related to the favored terrain). When you reach Rank III and V you may choose an additional favored terrain or increase bonuses of a certain terrain by 2.

## Rank II

<u>Expert Tracker:</u> You are able to find out information about your prey just by watching their trail. Using a move action you can find an opening in your enemy's defense, reducing the amount of advantage dice it has in defense rolls by one against your next attack. Each additional action spent will reduce the number of disadvantage dice by 1, reaching a minimum of 0. You can also spend a short rest at a specific location looking for clues of events that have transpired there, allowing you to get an idea of the events that happened at least two hours ago.

<u>Stalker:</u> You move with great stealth while tracking your prey. As a standard action you can hide in such a way that you cannot be detected by perception rolls, effectively making you invisible. To use this ability you must be out of sight of other creatures. This effect will remain until you attack or perform a particularly noisy action, and while it remains active you must move at half speed. Creatures with the ability expert tracker can attempt to detect you by rolling perception against your stealth. Stalker can only be used if you are in one of our favored terrains.

## Rank III

<u>Quarry:</u> As a move action you can designate a target as your quarry, immediately making it your favored enemy. You automatically succeed at all attempts to track your prey quarry if it is not in its favored terrain, and all permanent injuries you inflict on it will be one level higher. This ability can only be used once per day.

<u>Fast Tracker:</u> You are able to move at normal speed when using Stalker. In addition, declaring a target as a Favored Enemy now costs you a standard action and once per turn you use Expert tracker as a bonus action.

## Rank IV

<u>Camouflage:</u> You can use Stalker even if you are in your target's field of view as long as you are in your favored terrain. In addition, you are able to use this ability by spending a move action and it can be used in any type of terrain. 

<u>Terrain Master:</u> You know the land like the back of your hand. While you are in your favored terrain you gain immunity to difficult terrain and obstacles typical of it. You will get gain of the following abilities depending on the preferred terrain you have chosen. If you have more than one favored terrain you can only have one of the following skills active:

- **Arctic**: You receive resistance to cold damage equal to your rank in Track. You suffer no negative effects from extreme cold and snowstorms will not disrupt your field of view, allowing you to see without difficulty up to 60 feet away.
- **Desert**: You receive resistance to fire and necrotic damage equal to your rank in Track. You suffer no negative effects from extreme heat and you can survive an additional day without eating or drinking. 
- **Mountain**: Increase your Climb speed by 15 feet and you suffer no negative effects from extreme cold or high altitudes.
- **Underground**: Increase your Climbing speed by 15 feet. You receive resistance to poison equal to your rank in Track and you can see in the dark up to 60 feet away. 
- **Aquatic**: Increases your Swim speed by 15 feet and you can hold your breath for two additional turns.
- **Urban**: Increase your jump speed by 10 feet and you can use Stalker even if you are in a large crowd of people.
- **Forest:** You receive resistance to nature magic equal to your rank in Track. Increases your base speed by 15 feet and wild animals will not be naturally hostile against you

## Rank V 

<u>Master hunter:</u> The first strike you make is the most deadly. The first attack you make against a specific target will deal +1d6 damage and if you manage to land a critical hit it must succeed in a CON check or it will die instantly. Damage gained by master hunter will stack with sneak attack.

<u>Unstoppable Predator:</u> Choosing a target as your quarry now costs you a bonus action and you gain advantage on all attack and defense rolls against it. Your quarry ability will now recharge by doing a short rest.
