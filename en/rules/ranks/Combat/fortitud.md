## Rank I

Roll an additional challenge die on defensive CON rolls.

<u>Enhanced Vitality:</u> Increase your base HP by a value equal to your Fortitude rank x 2. You are able to remain conscious even if you are at 0 HP, falling unconscious only when your vitality and HP reach 0. Each time you take an action while at 0 HP you suffer 1 non-lethal damage (3 non-lethal damage if it is a full turn action).

<u>Natural armor:</u> Your body is able to resist weapon attacks. You gain natural armor equal to your fortitude rank + 1. Natural armor will reduce weapon damage you suffer but does not count as armor for the purposes of slashing weapons. Cold, fire and necrotic damage will also be reduced by natural armor. In case you have the physical enhancement of the same name because you have spent [PT](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/crear%20criaturas.html#puntos-de-transformaci%C3%B3n) both effects will not accumulate, but your base natural armor will be increased by 2.

## Rank II

Roll an additional challenge die on defensive CON rolls.

<u>Resist Death:</u> Once per combat when an attack reduces you to negative HP or causes instant death you may revive to 1 HP. This ability cannot be used against coup de grace or if your vitality is equal to 0.

<u>Superior Constitution:</u> You gain resistance against [poisons](../poisons_diseases.md#poisons), [diseases](../poisons_diseases.md#diseases), stunning and toxic gases equal to your Constitution stat - 2. The resistance granted by this ability also works against supernatural poisons and diseases.

## Rank III

Roll an additional challenge die on defensive CON rolls.

<u>Quick Recovery:</u> You heal all your lost HP with a short rest, and with a long rest reduce the level of a permanent wound by 1 (normally you need a med action to reduce permanent wounds). If you already have an ability that grants you regeneration you increase the number of Vitality that heals you per turn by 1.

<u>Resist Weapons:</u> Once per turn you can reduce the level of a permanent wound you receive by one step as a reaction. This ability can also be used to convert an instant-kill attack such as [master hunter](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Combate/rastrear.html) into a severe permanent wound. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to your constitution stat.
