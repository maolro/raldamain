## Rank I

You roll an additional challenge die on defensive Charisma rolls.

<u>Commanding voice:</u> Through inspiring words or imperious orders you strengthen the morale and strength of your allies. Initiating this effect requires a standard action, and until you suffer a minor permanent wound all your allies gain an Advantage die on all their rolls and are inspired. Your allies must see and hear you to benefit from the effect.

<u>Frightful presence:</u> You are a fearsome figure on the battlefield. All creatures of lower challenge level are Spooked until you suffer a permanent wound. This ability affects everyone within 30 feet and does not affect creatures under the effects of Presence.

<u>Unbreakable Will:</u> You have resistance equal to your rank against fear and can use Car instead of Wisdom on rolls against influence. If you have ranks in Influence, when you use the Persuasive skill you fascinate those who interact with you.

## Rank II

<u>:</u> As a standard action make a morale roll affecting all enemies within 30 feet. Creatures you succeed against become Frightened, and creatures that are already Frightened end up Frightened. This ability cannot be used more times against the same group of creatures.

<u>Tactician:</u> When using commander's voice, you can direct allies to perform complex tactics. These are some of them:

- **Shield wall**: Each ally gets an additional Challenge die in shield rolls if adjacent to a shielded ally. They also add an additional amount of Difficulty dice to the roll for each ally adjacent to it.
- **Expert Flankers**: Your allies roll an additional Advantage die and take +1 base damage when flanking an opponent. Damage from this ability stacks with sneak attack.
- **Surveillance**: Your allies cannot be caught by surprise if at least one of them is not surprised.
- **Scatter**: Your allies gain the ability [Evasion](http://raldamain.com/rules/Combate/reflejos.html) and can move 5 feet after succeeding on a Dexterity roll. They may spend a perk to move an additional 5 feet.

<u>Inspiration:</u> You have a pool of inspiration points equal to 1+Rank. Spend a point of inspiration for you or your ally to gain an Advantage die on a roll. This ability can only be used on allies under the commander's voice effects and the points are regained after a long rest.

## Rank III

You roll an additional Challenge die on defensive Charisma rolls.

<u>Indomitable:</u> Your willpower allows you to resist the impossible. A number of times per day equal to your Rank-2 , reroll any skill roll, attack or defensive, canceling the previous result. This new roll retains the bonuses of the previous roll and you must keep the new result (you cannot use Indomitable on the same roll more than once). You have resistance equal to your Rank-1 against mental effects.

<u>Inspire heroics:</u> As a standard action, grant an ally or you the strength of a hero. A creature affected by this ability has +R-1 temporary HP, one Advantage die on attack rolls, and the mighty will ability (receives one Disadvantage die on defensive charisma rolls if it already has it). This effect lasts until the target loses their temporary HP and you can affect a maximum number of people equal to your rank-1.

## Rank IV

<u>Incite Panic:</u> As a full turn action, incite your opponents to flee wildly. This ability works like frighten, but creatures with 4 or fewer HP are confused (a confused creature moves in a random direction each turn and attacks the first hostile creature it sees). You cannot scare creatures that have Presence effects.

<u>Inflame emotions:</u> Your will alters the emotions of weak characters, lifting their spirits or plunging them into despair. Spend a standard action to use inflame emotions, and with with this ability you can affect an individual person or a group of people with a lower level. If the target fails a wisdom roll against you, he becomes either animated (increases his attitude towards you by 1 level and receives an Advantage die on all his rolls) or desperate (receives a Disadvantage die on all his rolls, cannot be affected by presence rolls). Animated and desperate counteract each other.

## Rank V

You roll an additional challenge die on defensive Charisma rolls.

<u>Inspire legend:</u> When using Inspire Heroism, the affected target temporarily increases one of their stats by 1 and gains one use of the Untamed ability (if you already have it, you become immune to mental and morale effects).

<u>Master tactician:</u> Your Lead Combatants skill now allows you to have two tactics at once, plus you can make your allies change tactics as a move action without needing to reactivate the skill.
