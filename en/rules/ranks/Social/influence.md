## Rank I

Add your influence rank to persuasion, deception and insight checks.

<u>Mask:</u> You hide your true intentions under a real or figurative mask, concealing your true identity to accomplish your plans. This ability grants you resistance equal to your Influence rank against insight checks to detect whether you are lying or to see through your disguise. In addition, it is impossible to distinguish the link between you and your false identity unless you give strong hints of it. 

<u>Persuasive:</u> Your silver tongue is capable of getting you out of trouble. As a standard action you can make an influence check against a target's wisdom or charisma (the statistic used is chosen by the GM). If you succeed, your target's attitude towards you will increase by one step, reaching a maximum of friendly. This ability cannot be used on hostile creatures and will only have an effect on the same person once a day. At rank V you can affect all creatures within 30 feet with this ability.

## Rank II

<u>Rumormonger:</u> You have an excellent ear for rumors and gossip in addition to a keen ability to find them. Employing this skill requires spending two hours searching numerous public places such as taverns, markets, or bars. Employing this skill requires an Influence roll against a difficulty set by the master depending on the rarity of the rumor. Critical successes allow you to find clues while critical failures could attract unwanted attention. If you have ranks in Track and have chosen an urban favored terrain you are able to employ this skill to gather information from a person as if you were tracking them.

<u>Exploit favors:</u> Your strong persuasion skills allow you to subtly move friendly individuals to perform certain favors for you. Asking for a favor is an Influence roll made against a difficulty decided by the GM according to the risk of the favor and the attitude of your target towards you. If a favor is too dangerous or preposterous the GM may consider that the target will refuse no matter what. Some examples of favors are asking for a loan, asking about private information or performing a task for you.

## Rank III

<u>Guarded mind:</u> You are able to suppress certain thoughts to protect yourself from mind magic, granting you resistance to them equal to your Influence rank - 1. In the event that an attempt to read your mind fails you may display the information you wish without the mind mage noticing that it has been altered. This way magic will not be able to determine your true identity or identify whether you are telling the truth.

<u>Blackmail:</u> The rumors they find can lead you to uncover the dirty laundry of certain influential figures. Finding such information requires an influence check against a harder difficulty for which all modifiers you receive for favored enemy or terrain will apply. In case you succeed you can use the discovered information to force your target to follow your orders and perform risky favors even though it is hostile. However, the blackmailed creature will try to hide the information and silence you at all costs.

## Rank IV

<u>Perfect Imitation:</u> Your mastery of deception allows you to adopt the identity of real people with the Mask skill, perfectly imitating the way they speak and act. Using this skill requires you to spend several days studying and observing your target to imitate their actions more fluently (the exact time will be decided by the GM). The imitation will be indistinguishable to the real person to even  his closest acquaintances, but you can arouse suspicion if you act differently or do not know certain information that he would know. 

<u>Gaslighting:</u> You are so adept at lying that you are capable of making your targets doubt their own senses. By succeeding on an Influence roll against a character who has a neutral or greater attitude towards you you can make them doubt the veracity of an event up to 10 minutes long, causing them to treat it as if it had been all a dream or part of their imagination. This ability does not work if there is reliable proof that the event occurred or there are other witnesses, and in case you fail the creature with whom you interact will reduce its attitude towards you by one step. 

## Rank V

<u>Sow discord:</u> Your words are capable of turning friends into enemies and breaking the strongest alliances. Using this ability costs a standard action and for it you must make an Influence roll against any number of people within 30 feet of you (if they are on the same side you must roll against the leader's Charisma stat). If you succeed, they will start to doubt each other and will reduce the attitude they have towards each other by one step (this will be reduced by two steps if you have incriminating information from one of them). If you reduce the attitude to neutral they will lose all morale bonuses and will not be able to flank or defend each other. 

<u>Puppet master:</u> You are able to reduce the people to to simple puppets using only your words, manipulating them to ensure their loyalty or destroy their willpower. Once per interaction you can make an influence roll against your target which will cause them to lose 1d6 points of sanity (1d8 if you know a important information about your target). In case you manage to reduce their sanity to 0 you can obtain their absolute and unconditional loyalty or force them to commit suicide. This ability cannot be used on characters hostile to you unless you have a way to blackmail them.
