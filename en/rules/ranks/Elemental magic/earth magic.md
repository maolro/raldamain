## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with elemental earth magic.

<u>Elemental attack:</u> As a standard action you manipulate the earth to attack your enemies, flinging stones or earth against them. This attack will deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and it can target a 5 ft area up to 30 feet away. If you hit a creature with an elemental attack larger than its own size it must succeed in a heroics check against your elemental attack or be pushed 1d6 x 5 feet and fall prone. 

<u>Elemental defense:</u> You are capable of using your element to defend yourself from attacks, which is known as an elemental parry. You can only protect yourself with this ability from elemental, magic or ranged attacks (at rank III this ability can be used to defend yourself against melee attacks).

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. This ability can be used to increse the size of an elemental attack by 5 feet and its damage by 1d6 or do an additional elemental attack per turn. At rank II this ability can be used to increase the size of one of the obstacles you create with Control earth by 5 feet. Elemental overflow can only be used once per turn.

## Rank II

<u>Stone wall:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall of solid stone 15 x rank feet long and 5 x rank feet high. This wall will grant full cover to all creatures behind it, protecting them from both ranged and magical attack. The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you try to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the beginning of your turn if you keep both walls active. Each 10 ft square section of the wall has HP equal to 4 + rank and 8 DEF and it is immune to all energy damage save for thunder. An stone wall can also be created as a reaction once per round if you have entered form of the mountain.

<u>Control earth:</u> You capable of manipulating the earth beneath your feet. As a standard action you can manipulate a total volume of earth equal to 5 x your elemental magic rank, shaping it as you wish. With this ability you can create difficult terrain, barriers, elevations or holes in any place you wish. The height and depth of these obstacles may not exceed 5 feet and they grant cover to creatures behind them.

<u>Form of the mountain:</u> You can enter a state of focus and full defense known as form of the mountain as a move action. While you remain in form of the mountain all attacks you make will incrase their size by 5 feet and damage by 1d6 and you will gain a bonus equal to your rank + 1 to all defense rolls. Form of the mountain requires your absolute concentration and its bonuses will be lost if you move more than 5 feet per round or become unfocused. At rank IV this ability will increase the size of your attacks by 10 feet and damage by 1d8. 

## Rango III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Earthen grasp:</u> Whenever you hit a target with an elemental attack instead of dealing damage you can choose to wrap a part of its body with stone, grappling them with the strength of earth. A target grappled this way can be moved up to 15 feet in any direction as a move action and it will only be able to free itself by succeeding in a wreck check against your elemental attack. The effects of this grip will depend of the body part you strike, working in a similar way as the entangle ability. You cannot grapple more creatures simultaneously than your air magic rank - 2

<u>Wait and strike:</u> You have mastered the art of waiting patiently for the right opportunity, resisting blows until your enemy commits a fatal mistake. If you are in form of the mountain and enter defensive position you are able to do an opportunity attack as a reaction against any creature that misses its attack against you (this attack will count as a feint if it is a critical miss or you roll critical defense). Whenever you strike this way you will lose all bonuses you have from defensive position.

## Rango IV

<u>Collapse:</u> As a full-round action you can provoke a collapse in an area of up to 60 square feet formed mainly of stone or earthen materials, such as a cave or building. All creatures in the affected area must roll defense or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and become buried by the falling debris on failure, becoming both grappled and blinded. A creature trapped this way can attempt to escape the same way as it would escape a grapple, and if it remains trapped for more than a round it will begin to suffocate.

<u>Stone spikes:</u> You can deal piercing instead of bludgeoning damage with elemental attacks. An elemental attack that deals piercing damage will increase its base damage by 2 an all permanent injuries it inflicts will be 1 level higher, but to create one you must spend an additonal move action shaping stone for this purpose (with elemental overflow this can be used as a bonus action). This ability also lets you fill an area with spikes when using control earth, which in addition to counting as difficult terrain it will inflict 2 non-lethal damage to all creatures that attempt to pass through such area.

## Rango V

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20.

<u>Earthquake:</u> As a full-round action usable once per combat you can release a 60-foot radius shockwave capable of destroying weak structures in the area. All creatures on ground affected by a shockwave must succeed in a heroics check or fall prone and all buildings in the area made of stone or other brittle materials will immediately collapse (particularly large or solid buildings cannot be destroyed by this effect, although they will suffer slight structural damage). An area affected by a this ability also will become difficult terrain due to fallen debris and sinkholes.

<u>Chasm:</u> As a full-round action usable once per combat you can form a deep chasm 60 feet long and 30 feet deep. All creatures in the affected area must succeed in a dodge check against your elementa attack or fall into the chasm, taking 8 fall damage and taking a severe permanent inury. Creatures within a chasm can also be affected by a collapse.
