## Rank I 

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with air magic.

<u>Wind attack:</u> As a standard action you can unleash a powerful blast of air that pushes your targets. On a hit this attack will push your target 1d6 x 5 feet in a direction of your choice. If your target collides with a solid surface they will suffer fall damage as if they had fallen from a height equal to the number of feet of movement they failed to travel (for example, if they are pushed 30 feet and collide after 10 feet of movement, they will suffer damage as if they had fallen 20 feet). To throw your target in a vertical direction you must additionally succeed in a combat maneuver check against them after you hit. Bonuses gained from resistance to combat maneuvers will apply to this attack.

<u>Elemental defense:</u> You are capable of using your element to defend yourself from attacks, which is known as an elemental parry. You can only protect yourself with this ability from elemental, magic or ranged attacks (at rank III this ability can be used to defend yourself against melee attacks).

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. With this ability you can increase the area of your attack to a line 10 feet wide and 60 feet long, make an additional elemental attack, or increase the strength of winds in a 40-foot area by one step. This ability can only be used once per turn.

## Rank II

<u>Wall of wind:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall of raging winds 15 x rank feet long and 5 x rank feet high. The wall prevents projectiles from passing and a creature must spend a move action to attempt a heroism check against your elemental magic to pass through it (if it has equal or greater strength than your charisma it will not have to roll). The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you try to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage each turn you keep both walls active. The wall will be destroyed if it affected by another elemental wind attack. An wall of wind can also be created as a reaction once per round if you are in an area with severe winds.

<u>Flurry of attacks:</u> Making elemental attacks now cost you a move action instead of a standard action. Additionally, if you manage to succesfully launch an enemy into the air with your first attack all subsequent attacks against them can push them more feet upwards without having to do a combat maneuver or slam them to the ground with greater force, making them take 1d6 additional fall damage and increasing the level of all permanent injuries by one step.

## Rank III 

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20

<u>Wind Grab:</u> You are capable of grabbing a target with your elemental attacks, leaving them at the mercy of the skies. Whenever you hit a target with an elemental attack you can attampt to grab them instead of pushing, making a grapple maneuver against them on impact. Targets grabbed by your attacks will be incapable of defending themselves against your elemental attacks and count as being in the air for the purposes of flurry of attacks. You cannot grapple more creatures simultaneously than your air magic rank - 2

<u>Awaken the storm:</u> The power of ancient storms flows through your body. Whenever you enter an environment affected by a storm all elemental attacks you make will inflict +2 lightning damage. You also gain thea ability to increase the strength of the winds in an area by one step as a bonus action (you cannot reach a wind strength level higher than your rank). Each level of wind strength will grant a +1 bonus to all attack and defense rolls and a -1 penalty to perception checks.

## Rank IV 

<u>Suffocate:</u> Spending a move action youmust do a CON check against you or become fatigued (. As a standard action you can steal the air from the lungs of a grappled creature, causing it to start drowning. A creature will drown if it remains grappled by you for a number of turns equal to its Constitution stat (you can employ an elemental attack to reduce that number of turns by 1).

<u>Wirlwind:</u> As a full-round action you can form a powerful whirlwind 60 feet wide and 60 feet high. Winds inside a whirlwind have strength level 5 and all creatures which enter its area must succeed on a heroism check or be pulled inside. Creatures trapped inside a whirlwind will be grappled and will suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the end of its turn. The whirlwind will remain for 5 turns or until you lose focus, and when it fades all creatures trapped by it will immediately begin to fall.

## Rank V 

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20.

<u>Control weather:</u> The heavens obey your call and will unleash their fury on your enemies. This ability lets you create or calm storms as a two-round ritual which must be cast in an outdoor area. Storms also empower your air magic abilities, letting you do an additional elemental magic attack per turn and increasing wind strength by 1. 

<u>Hurricane:</u> As a full-round action you can summon a powerful hurricane that will sweep away everything in sight. This ability can only be used once per day and will only affect a 100-foot area with wind strength 5 or greater. The hurricane will destroy all weak structures and it will work as an elemental attack which will push your targets 2d6 x 5 feet in a direction of your choice on hit (this includes vertical directions).
