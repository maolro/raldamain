## Rank I 

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with elemental water magic.

<u>Elemental Attack:</u> As a standard action you can unleash a powerful torrent of water that pushes your targets. On a hit this attack will push your target 1d6 x 5 feet in a direction of your choice. If your target collides with a solid surface they will suffer fall damage as if they had fallen from a height equal to the number of feet of movement they failed to travel (for example, if they are pushed 30 feet and collide after 10 feet of movement, they will suffer damage as if they had fallen 20 feet). To throw your target in a vertical direction you must additionally succeed in a combat maneuver check against them after you hit. Bonuses gained from resistance to combat maneuvers will apply to this attack.

<u>State change</u>: You have the ability to change the state of water, transforming it into ice or steam. This ability unlocks ranks in elemental ice magic. Additionaly, you are able to spend a standard action to turn an amount of water with volume equal to 10 x rank cubic feet into mist, obscuring an area of corresponding size and removing that amount of water. An area obscured by mist will grant concealment to all creatures inside.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. This ability can be used to attack all creatures within a 10-foot radius (30-foot radius if you are surrounded by water) or a line 10 feet wide and 60 feet long. At rank II you can use this ability to store an additional attack without the need to expend actions. Elemental overflow can only be used once per turn.

<u>Elemental defense:</u> You are capable of using your element to defend yourself from attacks, which is known as an elemental parry. You can only protect yourself with this ability from elemental, magic or ranged attacks. At rank III this ability can be used to defend yourself against melee attacks).

## Rank II

<u>Water Dance:</u> You are capable of storing elemental attacks to enhance your defense and empower future attacks. To store an attack you must spend a move action or use elemental overflow. You are capable of storing a maximum number of attacks equal to your elemental magic rank + 1 and you will lose all stored attacks if an effect breaks your concentration. As a bonus action you can spend a stored attack to empower another, increasing its area of effect by 5 feet and adding a +1 bonus to attack rolls and the amount of feet pushed (+1 damage if you empower an ice elemental attack). Stored attacks will also bolster your defense, adding a +1 bonus to elemental parry rolls for each stored attack you have. You can also employ one of your elemental attacks to make an additional elemental attack as a bonus action.

<u>Water wall:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall of roaring water 15 x rank feet long and 5 x rank feet high. The wall prevents projectiles from passing and a creature must spend a move action to attempt a heroism check against your elemental magic to pass through it (if it has equal or greater strength than your charisma it will not have to roll). The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you try to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the beginning of your turn if you keep both walls active. The wall is destroyed if it is turned into gas with change state or it stops an elemental fire attack with a radius greater than 15 feet. A water wall can also be created as a reaction by expending 2 stored attacks.

## Rank III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Raging Currents:</u> As a standard action you can increase the strength of currents in am adjacent pool of water, turning it into difficult terrain and granting disadvantage to all athletics (swim) checks. Whenever you strike a target with an elemental attack larger than its size you can do a free grapple maneuver against it. A creature grappled by an elemental attack will suffer 1d6 non-lethal damage per turn and will be at risk of drowning. You cannot grapple more creatures simultaneously than your air magic rank - 2

<u>Fluid attacks:</u> By focusing on an attack you can prevent it from disappearing after being used, maintaining a constant whip of water. Whenever you make an elemental attack you can spend an additional move action to prevent it from disappearing. An attack preserved this way lets you make an extra attack per turn as a bonus action as long as you maintain concentration on it. You cannot focus on more than a single attack this way. 

## Rank IV

<u>Vortex:</u> Using a standard action you can form a 30-foot radius vortex in a body of water of your choice. All creatures in the vortex must succeed in a strength check against your elemental magic or they will be caught by the currents, taking 1d4 non-lethal damage per turn and dragging them 10 feet toward the center of the vortex. When a creature reaches the center it will immediately begin to drown. You can spend 2 attacks from your reserve or take 2 non-lethal damage to increase the radius of the vortex by 10 feet.

<u>Water bubble:</u> As a standard action you can form a bubble the size of a human head capable of storing breathable air, allowing creatures that come in contact with it to be able to breathe underwater. A water bubble can also be employed offensively, letting you flood a grappled or incapacitated target's lungs with water. A creature affected this way will become nauseated and begin to drown (if it is already drowning reduce the amount of rounds it can hold its breath by 1).

## Rank V

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Tsunami:</u> As a full-round action you can form a massive tidal wave capable of devastating a region. To use this ability you must spend 6 stored attacks and be in an area adjacent to a large pool of water, such as a lake or the sea. The tsunami is a wave 30 feet high and 100 feet wide and will move 30 feet per turn, destroying all weak structures in its path. Every round the wave remains active it will reduce its height by 10 feet, dissolving once its height is reduced to 0 feet (you can spend a stored attack to increase the wave's height by 5 feet). All creatures in the path of your wave must succeed in a STR check or suffer 2d4 non-lethal damage and be swept away by the wave, becoming grappled by  it. A creature grappled this way will take 1d4 non-lethal damage per turn and be at risk of drowning. Additionally, if the wave collides with a large solid surface it will immediately dissolve and all creatures inside it will take fall damage equal to the amount of feet the wave has pushed them.

<u>Control Weather:</u> You are capable of manipulating water in clouds to cause changes in the weather. This ability lets you create or calm storms as two-round ritual which must be cast in an outdoor area. Storms also empower your water abilities, letting you increase the amount of stored attacks by 1 every round you spend in a storm-affected area. If you have ranks in ice magic this ability allows you to create a snowstorm if you find yourself in a terrain where such event is possible.
