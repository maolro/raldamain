## Rank I 

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with air magic.

<u>Wind attack:</u> As a standard action you can unleash a powerful blast of air that pushes your targets. On a hit this attack will push your target 1d6 x 5 feet in a direction of your choice. If your target collides with a solid surface they will suffer fall damage as if they had fallen from a height equal to the number of feet of movement they failed to travel (for example, if they are pushed 30 feet and collide after 10 feet of movement, they will suffer damage as if they had fallen 20 feet). To throw your target in a vertical direction you must additionally succeed in a combat maneuver check against them after you hit. Bonuses gained from resistance to combat maneuvers will apply to this attack.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. With this ability you can increase the area of your attack to a line 10 feet wide and 60 feet long, make an additional elemental attack, or increase the strength of winds in a 40-foot area by one step. This ability can only be used once per turn.

## Rank II

<u>Water wall:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall of raging winds 15 x rank feet long and 5 x rank feet high. The wall prevents projectiles from passing and a creature must spend a move action to attempt a heroism check against your elemental magic to pass through it (if it has equal or greater strength than your charisma it will not have to roll). The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you try to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage each turn you keep both walls active. The wall will be destroyed if it affected by another elemental wind attack. A water wall can also be created as a reaction once per round if you are in an area with severe winds.

<u>Flurry of attacks:</u> Making elemental attacks now cost you a move action instead of a standard action. Additionally, if you manage to succesfully launch an enemy into the air with your first attack all subsequent attacks against them can push them more feet upwards without having to do a combat maneuver or slam them to the ground with greater force, making them take 1d6 additional fall damage and increasing the level of all permanent injuries by one step.

## Rank III 

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20

<u>Wind Grab:</u> You are capable of grabbing a target with your elemental attacks, leaving them at the mercy of the skies. Whenever you hit a target with an elemental attack you can attampt to grab them instead of pushing, making a grapple maneuver against them on impact. Targets grabbed by your attacks will be incapable of defending themselves against your elemental attacks and count as being in the air for the purposes of flurry of attacks. You cannot grapple more creatures simultaneously than your air magic rank - 2

<u>Awaken the storm:</u> The power of ancient storms flows through your body. Whenever you enter an environment affected by a storm all elemental attack												`			instead of dealing damage you can increase the strength of the winds in an area by one step (you cannot raise the strength of the wind to a level higher than your rank). Each level of wind force adds one Advantage die to your attack rolls and one Disadvantage die to all ranged attack and perception rolls made by creatures without ranks in [air ascendancy](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Ascendencias/ascendencia%20de%20aire.html).

## Rank IV 

<u>Suffocate:</u> You can spend 2 perks or use an elemental attack to [fatigue](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#fatigada) a target for one turn (4 perks to leave it [exhausted](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#exhausta)). As a standard action you can steal the air from the lungs of a grappled creature, causing it to start drowning. A creature will drown if it remains grappled by you for a number of turns equal to its Constitution stat (you can employ an elemental attack to reduce that number of turns by 1).

<u>Wirlwind:</u> As a full-turn action you can form a strong whirlwind 30 feet in radius and 90 feet high. A whirlwind counts as having winds with strength level 5 and all creatures in its area must roll [heroism](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#hero%C3%ADsmo-fue)vs. your elemental magic dice or they will be pulled inside. Each creature inside the whirlwind is grappled and will suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the end of the round. The whirlwind will remain for 5 turns or until you lose concentration. When it fades away the creatures will start falling immediately.

## V Rank 

Add a looseness die to all your elemental attacks. 

<u>Control the weather:</u> The heavens obey your call and will unleash their fury on your enemies. Once a day you can perform a 10-minute ritual to call a storm to your region. The storm will increase the strength of the wind by one step and grants concealment to all creatures in it. You can also make an additional elemental attack per turn as a bonus action (this can also be a storm elemental attack). 

<u>Hurricane:</u> As a full turn action you can summon a hurricane that will sweep away everything in your vicinity. This ability can only be used once per day and will only affect an environment where the winds in that area are strength 5 or greater (it will affect a maximum area of 100 feet). The hurricane will destroy all weak structures and allows you to make an elemental attack against all creatures in that area with 5 bonus dice added (does not stack with those received with Awaken the Storm).
