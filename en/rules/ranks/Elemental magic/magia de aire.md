## Rank I 

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with air magic.

<u>Wind attack:</u> As a standard action you can unleash a powerful blast of air that pushes your targets. On a hit this attack will push your target 1d6 x 5 feet in a direction of your choice. If your target collides with a solid surface they will suffer fall damage as if they had fallen from a height equal to the number of feet of movement they failed to travel (for example, if they are pushed 30 feet and collide after 10 feet of movement, they will suffer damage as if they had fallen 20 feet). To throw your target in a vertical direction you must additionally succeed in a combat maneuver check against them after you hit.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. With this ability you can increase the area of your attack to a line 10 feet wide and 60 feet long, make an additional elemental attack, or increase the strength of winds in a 40-foot area by one step. This ability can only be used once per turn.

## Rank II

<u>Wind wall:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall of raging winds with length equal to 15 x rank feet long and height equal to 5 x rank feet. The wall prevents the passage of projectiles and gases, including creatures in gaseous form. The wall will remain until you lose focus, and if you attempt to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage each turn you keep both walls active. The wall will be destroyed if hit by another wind elemental effect. Wall of air can be created as a reaction by spending 2 disadvantage generated in an elemental parry.

<u>Flurry of attacks:</u> You can use a move action to make an additional elemental attack. Additional move actions granted to you by [air ascendancy](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Ascendencias/ascendencia%20de%20fuego.html) or [reflexes](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Combate/reflejos.html) can be used for this ability. If you launch an enemy into the air with your first attack, you can spend successes generated on your subsequent attacks to launch him an additional 5 feet upward or slam him into the ground with greater force, causing him to suffer damage as if he had fallen from a higher height (each success generated will count as if he had fallen an additional 5 feet, suffering the appropriate effects).

## Rank III 

Add a looseness die to all your elemental attacks. 

<u>Wind Grab:</u> You can grab a target with your elemental attacks, leaving them at the mercy of the air. When making an elemental attack you can attempt to grab him instead of pushing him, making a grapple attempt against him on impact (he will be able to defend himself with [heroism](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#hero%C3%ADsmo-fue)). If you succeed the target will remain [grappled](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#agarrada) and will not be able to defend himself from your elemental attacks. It also counts as being in the air for attack sequence purposes, so you can spend 1 success to move it 5 feet in any direction. You may not grapple more creatures than your elementalism rank - 2.

<u>Awaken the storm:</u> The power of storms flows through your body. You unlock ranks in [storm magic](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20tormenta.html). When entering an environment affected by a storm your attacks deal 2 electrical damage automatically on impact. When making an elemental attack instead of dealing damage you can increase the strength of the winds in an area by one step (you cannot raise the strength of the wind to a level higher than your rank). Each level of wind force adds one Advantage die to your attack rolls and one Disadvantage die to all ranged attack and perception rolls made by creatures without ranks in [air ascendancy](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Ascendencias/ascendencia%20de%20aire.html).

## Rank IV 

<u>Suffocate:</u> You can spend 2 perks or use an elemental attack to [fatigue](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#fatigada) a target for one turn (4 perks to leave it [exhausted](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#exhausta)). As a standard action you can steal the air from the lungs of a grappled creature, causing it to start drowning. A creature will drown if it remains grappled by you for a number of turns equal to its Constitution stat (you can employ an elemental attack to reduce that number of turns by 1).

<u>Wirlwind:</u> As a full-turn action you can form a strong whirlwind 30 feet in radius and 90 feet high. A whirlwind counts as having winds with strength level 5 and all creatures in its area must roll [heroism](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#hero%C3%ADsmo-fue)vs. your elemental magic dice or they will be pulled inside. Each creature inside the whirlwind is grappled and will suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the end of the round. The whirlwind will remain for 5 turns or until you lose concentration. When it fades away the creatures will start falling immediately.

## V Rank 

Add a looseness die to all your elemental attacks. 

<u>Control the weather:</u> The heavens obey your call and will unleash their fury on your enemies. Once a day you can perform a 10-minute ritual to call a storm to your region. The storm will increase the strength of the wind by one step and grants concealment to all creatures in it. You can also make an additional elemental attack per turn as a bonus action (this can also be a storm elemental attack). 

<u>Hurricane:</u> As a full turn action you can summon a hurricane that will sweep away everything in your vicinity. This ability can only be used once per day and will only affect an environment where the winds in that area are strength 5 or greater (it will affect a maximum area of 100 feet). The hurricane will destroy all weak structures and allows you to make an elemental attack against all creatures in that area with 5 bonus dice added (does not stack with those received with Awaken the Storm).
