## Rank I

Add a proficiency die to your attack rolls.

<u>Entangling tendril</u>: As a standard action you can attack an enemy with a whip of tendrils. On hit with this attack you can grab a part of your target's body (this works like the [entangle](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#agarrada) skill). You can use one generated perk to move your target [grab](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#agarrada) 5 feet and 2 perks to cling to a natural surface (this way you don't have to concentrate on grabbing him). Your tendrils are automatically destroyed when you suffer a slashing or fire attack.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. With this ability you can make an Entangle attack that affects an area with a radius of 10 feet or make an additional Entangle or Alter Wood attack. Power reserve can only be used once per turn.

<u>Wood shape</u>: As a standard action you can alter the composition of an object made of wood with a maximum size of 5 cubic feet. The altered object can be used as a weapon, so it will inflict 1+Success physical damage on hit and you can spend 4 generated perks to inflict a light permanent wound (the object can be thrown a maximum distance of 60 feet, functioning as a ranged attack). At ranks III and V the size of objects you can alter with this ability increases by 5 feet.

<u>Elemental parry</u>: Your elemental parry allows you to protect yourself from enemy attacks. An elemental parry is a reaction that allows you to use your attack dice defensively to defend against attacks. You can only protect yourself from other elemental attacks or ranged attacks, being able to cancel a success once per turn. At Rank III you can use Elemental Parry against melee attacks and cancel a hit once per turn (two additional times at Rank V).

## Rank II

<u>Plant Growth</u>: As a turn action employable once per full day you can increase the size of plants within 100 feet, turning the entire area into difficult terrain. You get a die advantage on nature rolls in that area and can make an additional Entangle attack as a move action. If you affect a crop field with this ability its annual production will increase. 

<u>Wall of brambles</u>: As a standard action you can form a wall made of sharp brambles with length equal to 15 x rank feet long and height equal to 5 x rank feet. This wall is a barrier that grants full cover to all creatures behind it (it will grant partial cover if they attempt to attack from behind the wall). Wall brambles cause [bleed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#sangrado) to creatures grabbed by Entanglement that are in contact with it. If a creature is completely absorbed by the wall it will be incapacitated and suffer 2 non-lethal damage per turn.

## Rank III

Add a proficiency die to your attack rolls.

<u>Animate plants</u>: As a full-turn action you can infuse plants with life in a 70-foot area. This ability will only affect spaces that have a large volume of plants (i.e., places where plants cause difficult terrain). When a hostile creature passes through a space infested by animated plants it will immediately suffer the effects of Entangle. Creatures grabbed in this way will also suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the end of the round. This ability will remain active for one hour and can only be used once per day. 

<u>Control nature</u>: Animals, plants and spirits are not naturally hostile towards you and assist you when you are in danger. When you are in a natural environment that is your [favored terrain](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Combate/rastrear.html#rango-i) or your [harmonized region](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Ascendencias/ascendencia%20verdeante.html#rango-ii) you can call upon a number of natural allies as a standard action employable once per day. These allies can be any number of creatures totaling 12 [PT](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/crear%20criaturas.html#puntos-de-transformaci%C3%B3n). The number of total PT increases by three for each additional rank of nature magic you gain.

<u>Diminish plants</u>: You are able to reverse the growth of plants to maintain natural balance. As a standard action you can reduce the size of plants by 5 x rank cubic feet, eliminating the difficult terrain they form. This ability can also be used to remove a Bramble Wall or Framing effect, requiring in this case that you succeed on a nature magic roll against the nature magic dice of the effect's creator.

## Rank IV

<u>Summon Guardian</u>: A creature from the natural world acts as your guardian, protecting you even when you are away from home. Your guardian is a creature with PT equal to your rank x 3 and of spirit, plant, or animal type. The guardian will be loyal to you as long as you maintain your bond with nature and in case it dies you must spend a month in communion with nature in your preferred terrain to achieve a new one.

<u>Naturalize</u>: When you grab a creature with Entangle you can naturalize the non-magical artificial objects it carries. At the end of the round a creature grabbed by entangle will have the effectiveness of the armor and items it is wearing reduced by 1 (effectiveness is a value that indicates the usefulness of an item or armor, equaling a value equal to defense in the case of armor and base damage in the case of weapons). When the effectiveness of the object in question reaches 0 it will be completely destroyed.

## Rank V

Add a proficiency die to your attack rolls.

<u>Ironwood</u>: Your attacks with alter wood inflict +2 base damage and increase your defense by 2 if you are not wearing metal armor. Creatures grappled by Entangle will increase the level of a permanent wound on a location on their body by one step at the end of each round.

<u>Nature's wrath</u>: As a full-turn action you can punish your enemies with the power of the earth. This ability is usable once per day and with it attacks all creatures within 60 feet. Nature's fury does 5 + success physical damage and with it you can spend 2 perks to grab a target. You can affect up to 60 feet flying creatures, which will [fall](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/reglas%20de%20combate.html#ca%C3%ADdas) to the ground after being grappled.
