## Rank I

Add one looseness die to all your elemental attacks.

<u>Lower Temperatures:</u> As a standard action you can lower the temperatures of a 30-foot radius, increasing the level of [cold](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/terreno#%C3%A1rtico) by one step (this can only be used once per environment). If you are in an environment with a cold temperature or below you are able to freeze a volume of water measuring a number of cubic feet equal to 10 x your elemental magic rank as a standard action.

<u>Ray of frost:</u> You can use a standard action to attack a target within 60 feet with an icy ray. An icy bolt will do 2+successes cold damage and you can spend 2 perks to [slow](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#ralentizada) the enemy for 1 turn (4 perks to [paralyze](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#paralizada)). The cold damage you cause will deal vitality damage on hit and if you succeed in reducing a target's vitality to 0 with an elemental attack it will be frozen. A frozen creature will die of hypothermia after a number of rounds equal to its CON + 1 if it is not rescued within that amount of time unless you choose to prevent it. You must be in a cold environment in order to employ this ability.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to take non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. This ability allows you to make one additional elemental attack per turn, increase the splash radius of an attack by 10 feet, or turn it into an area attack that affects all creatures in a 20-foot cone. This ability can also be used to be able to freeze water as a move action (bonus action at rank III).

<u>Ice spines:</u> You are able to mold ice into sharp spines to attack your enemies. An icy thorn attack has a maximum distance of 60 feet and deals 3+success piercing damage on hit. You can spend generated perks to inflict permanent wounds as if it were a weapon, increasing the level of all wounds you inflict by one step upon reaching ranks III and V. An icy thorn attack can take the form of all types of weapons, thus being able to inflict slashing or blunt damage if you choose.

<u>Elemental parry</u>: Your element allows you to protect yourself from enemy attacks. An elemental parry is a reaction that allows you to use your attack dice defensively to defend against attacks. You can only protect yourself from other elemental attacks or ranged attacks, being able to cancel a success once per turn. At Rank III you can use Elemental Parry against melee attacks and cancel a hit once per turn (two additional times at Rank V).

## Rank II

<u>Slippery Ice:</u> Turning a water surface into ice makes it slippery for all creatures attempting to walk across it. A layer of [ice](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/terreno#%C3%A1rtico) affected in this way counts as difficult terrain and creatures walking on it are at risk of slipping if they do not move carefully. Thus, when a creature makes a charge or moves more than 30 feet a turn it must roll Acrobatics against your ice magic dice or it will immediately fall to the ground (you can spend the disadvantages generated to have it pushed 10 feet in any direction). As a standard action you can destroy a layer of ice with maximum surface area equal to your ice magic range x 10, turning it back into water. 

<u>Wall of ice:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall made of solid ice with length equal to 15 x rank feet long and height equal to 5 x rank feet. This wall is a barrier that grants full cover to all creatures behind it (it will grant partial cover if they attempt to attack from behind the wall). The wall will remain until you lose focus, and if you attempt to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage each turn you keep both walls active. Each 10 square foot section of the wall has HP equal to 2 + your elementalism rank, and it will be destroyed immediately if hit by a fire elemental attack with a radius greater than its size. Wall of ice can be created as a reaction by spending 2 disadvantage generated in an elemental save.

<u>Polar Mist:</u> The mists it forms are supernaturally cold, freezing creatures in them. A polar mist grants the slowed status effect to all creatures in it with no cold damage resistances and grants you superior concealment against ranged attacks. Also add an Advantage die to your attack rolls made against creatures in the mist's space. Creating a mist is a standard action and will occupy 10 feet per rank of elementalism.

## Rank III

Add a casting die to all your elemental attacks. Increase your base damage by 1.

<u>Snowstorm:</u> As a full turn action you can unleash a powerful storm of snow and hail. A snowstorm is an area attack that affects all creatures in a line 15 feet wide and 50 feet long, dealing cold damage equal to your elemental attack damage plus 2 blunt damage. If the snowstorm affects an area with cold temperatures it will immediately become difficult terrain. You must wait 3 turns before using this ability again, and you can reduce the duration by one turn by taking 1 non-lethal damage.

<u>Quick Freeze</u>: Freezing water costs you a bonus action if you are in an extremely cold environment. If a creature is in the water when you freeze it, it will be immediately trapped by the ice. This ability also causes your attacks to be able to freeze more easily, allowing you to spend 2 perks generated on hit to cause your target to begin to lose their body heat, causing them the effects of a [dexterity poison](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/venenos_enfermedades.html#veneno-de-des) (this will have gravity roll equal to your elemental magic dice and incidence of one minute). If your target is already affected by such a skill, either by quick freeze or extreme cold, you may spend 2 generated perks to increase the level of this by 1 (your target may roll CON to resist).

## Rank IV 

<u>Icy Prison:</u> As a standard action you may force a frozen creature into a state of suspended animation. It may roll heroism one last time to resist, but if it fails it will immediately fall unconscious (in this state it is unaware of its surroundings and will cease to age). Alternatively, this ability allows you to spend a standard action to freeze yourself, granting you ice protection with life equal to your elemental magic rank + 2 and 4 defense. Releasing yourself from this state costs you a bonus action, but if you spend more than an hour in it you will immediately fall unconscious.

<u>Blizzard:</u> You receive the ability to cast powerful blizzards of ice. These function like the [gale](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20aire.html#rango-i) ability, but will deal 2 additional cold damage and you can spend perks as if they were ice lightning. You are also able to perform a two-round ritual to call a snowfall to a location. The snowfall will give superior concealment to all creatures in it and turn the entire battlefield into difficult terrain. You cannot create a snowfall in warm areas.

## V Rank

Add one hit die to all your elemental attacks. Increase your base damage by 1.

<u>Polar Midnight:</u> As a full turn action you can drastically reduce the temperature in that location, making it as cold as the deepest north. Polar Midnight will reduce the temperature of the place where you are to extreme cold and shut down all heat sources in it, gaining all the advantages it gives you. If you use Lower Temperatures in an environment affected by Polar Midnight all the creatures in it will receive the status effect [slowed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#ralentizada). Polar Midnight will remain active for 10 turns and can only be used once a day. You cannot use Polar Midnight if you are in an extremely hot environment. 

<u>Stygian Cold:</u> Your cold freezes even creatures native to winter. The cold damage from your attacks passes through resistances and you can use perks from your ice attacks to cause permanent wounds (2 perks to cause a medium wound and 4 perks to cause a severe wound). However, you will not be able to inflict permanent wounds on cold-resistant creatures even if you can wound them.
