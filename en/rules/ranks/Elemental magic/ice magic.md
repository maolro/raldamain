## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with elemental earth magic.

<u>Lower Temperatures:</u> As a standard action you can lower the temperatures of a 30-foot radius, increasing the level of cold by one step (this can only be used once per environment). If you are in an environment with a cold temperature or below you are capable of freezing a volume of water measuring 10 x rank cubic feet as a standard action.

<u>Ray of frost:</u> You can use a standard action to attack a target within 60 feet with an icy ray. An ray of frost will deal 1d6 cold damage and on hit your target will become staggered if it has no protections against cold (if you score a critical hit it will become paralyzed). If you manage to deal hit point damage with a ray of frost attack your target must succeed in a CON check or become frozen. A frozen creature will die of hypothermia after a number of rounds equal to its CON + 1 unless you choose to prevent it (a frozen creature can be freed if it succeeds in a STR check or an ally exposes it to a source of heat). You must be in a cold environment in order to employ this ability.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to take 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. This ability can be used to increase the spash radius of an attack by 10 feet or attack all targets in a 15-foot cone. At rank II you can use this ability to store an additional attack without the need to expend actions. Elemental overflow can only be used once per turn.

<u>Ice spines:</u> You are able to mold ice into sharp spines to attack your enemies. An ice spike attack has a maximum range of 60 feet and deals 1d8 + CHA piercing damage on hit. An icy spike attack can take the form of all types of weapons, making it able to inflict slashing or bludgeonning damage if you choose or use combat maneuvers.

<u>Elemental parry</u>: You are capable of using your element to defend yourself from attacks, which is known as an elemental parry. You can only protect yourself with this ability from elemental, magic or ranged attacks. At rank III this ability can be used to defend yourself against melee attacks).

## Rank II

<u>Slippery Ice:</u> Whenever you turn a water surface into ice it will become slippery for all creatures attempting to walk across it. A layer of ice affected in this way counts as difficult terrain and creatures walking on it are at risk of slipping if they do not move carefully. Thus, when a creature makes a charge or moves more than 30 feet a turn it must succeed in an Acrobatics check against your ice magic or it will immediately fall prone and be pushed 10 feet in any direction. In addition, all creatures pushed on a layer of ice will move 10 additional feet and fall prone. As a standard action you can destroy a layer of ice with maximum surface area equal to your ice magic rank x 10, turning it back into water. 

<u>Wall of ice:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall made of solid ice 15 x rank feet long and 5 x rank feet high. This wall will grant full cover to all creatures behind it, protecting them from both ranged and magical attacks. The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you try to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the beginning of your turn if you keep both walls active. Each 10 ft square section of the wall has HP equal to 4 + rank and 4 DEF and it is immune to all energy damage save for thunder and fire. An ice wall can also be created as a reaction once per round if you are in a cold environment.

<u>Polar Mist:</u> The mists you form are supernaturally cold, freezing creatures in them. As a standard action you can create a cloud of freezing mist which will occupy an volume equal to 10 x rank square feet. All creatures that begin their turn in a polar mist will become staggered for a round and all attacks you make against creatures in a mist will have advantage.

## Rank III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Snowstorm:</u> As a full-round action you can unleash a powerful storm of snow and hail. A snowstorm is an area attack that affects all creatures in a line 15 feet wide and 50 feet long, inflicting 1d8 + CHA cold damage and 1d6 bludgeoning damage. An area affected by a snowstorm will also difficult terrain. This ability has a recharge time of 2 turns, and you can instantly recover it by using elemental overflow.

<u>Quick Freeze</u>: Freezing water costs you a bonus action if you are in an extremely cold environment. If a creature is in an area of water you freeze it will become immediately frozen unless it has a swim speed, in which case it must succeed in an athletics check against your elemental magic. This ability also causes your attacks to be able to freeze enemies more easily, allowing you to drain your target's body heat on hit which will cause them the effects of a dexterity poison with severity value equal to your elemental magic rank. If your target is already affected by this effect, either by quick freeze or extreme cold, it must succeed in a CON check against your elemental magic or increase its level by one step.

## Rank IV 

<u>Icy Prison:</u> As a standard action you can force a frozen creature into a state of suspended animation. The affected target can attempt one last time heroics check to resist, but on failure it will immediately fall unconscious and cease to age while it remains frozen. Alternatively, this ability allows you to spend a standard action to freeze yourself, granting you an armor of ice which grants you temporal HP equal to your elemental magic rank + 2 and 4 defense. Releasing yourself from this state costs you a bonus action, but if you spend more than an hour in it you will immediately fall unconscious.

<u>Blizzard:</u> You receive the ability to cast powerful blizzards of ice. Creating a blizzard costs a standard action and with it you can push a target 1d6 x 5 feet in any direction on hit in addition of inflicting 1d6 cold damage. You are also able to perform a two-round ritual to call a snowfall to a cold environment. The snowfall will give superior concealment to all creatures in it and turn the entire battlefield into difficult terrain. 

## Rank V

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20.

<u>Polar Midnight:</u> As a full-round action you can drastically reduce the temperature in that location, making it as cold as lands in the arctic circle. Polar Midnight will reduce the temperature of the place where you are to extreme cold and snuff all heat sources in it, in addition of letting you lower temperatures or do elemental attacks as a move action. If you use Lower Temperatures in an environment affected by Polar Midnight all the creatures in the area must succeed in a CON check or become staggered. Polar Midnight will remain active for 10 turns and can only be used once a day.

<u>Stygian Cold:</u> Your cold is even capable of freezing creatures native to winter. The cold damage from your attacks is capable of ignoring resistances and whenever you deal hit point damage to creatures without cold resistance they will suffer a mild permanent injruies in addition to becoming staggered. Creatures with cold resistances still gain bonuses in defense rolls to avoid status effects from your abilities.
