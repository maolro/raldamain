## Rank I 

Add a proficiecny die to all your elemental attacks.

<u>Lightning bolt:</u> As a standard action attack a target with lightning. This attack has a range of 30 feet and does 2+success electrical damage. You roll 1 additional advantage die against creatures wearing metal armor (2 additional advantage dice if it has heavy armor or heavy metal shield ). Spend 2 perks to make the target unable to use reactions for one turn (4 to slow). If you are in a storm you can make as a standard action a lightning strike on a target in an exposed location. This costs you a move action at rank III.

<u>Thunder Wave:</u> As a standard action initiate a thunderous wave in a 15-foot radius. This wave does 2+exits thunder damage and you can spend 2 perks to deafen an enemy (4 to stun). You shatter all glass objects or other fragile materials in the area.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. With this ability you can make a second elemental attack, increase your attack radius by 5 feet or have all your air attacks do +1 electrical damage. This ability can only be used once per turn.

## Rank II

<u>Chain Lightning</u>: Upon hitting with a lightning attack, spend 2 perks or a move action to make a lightning bolt jump from that target to another target within 20 feet of it. This ability can be used a number of times equal to your rank.

<u>Electric charge:</u> Employ an elemental attack to charge a 5-foot portion of air per range with electrical energy. You can make an elemental attack as an attack of opportunity against a creature passing through that area. in addition, if you affect a space that is in a wall of wind the entire muto will be charged. This effect lasts one turn for each level of strength of the air you charge.

## Rank III

Add a looseness die to all your elemental attacks.

<u>System shock:</u> On impact with an elemental attack, spend your perks to cause spasms in the target's muscles. This ability functions like the Spasms attrbute from blood magic.

<u>Destructive Wave:</u> You can contain thunder energy to release it later in a destructive wave, When you release the energy, it functions as a thunder wave attack that increases your radius by 5 feet and damage by 1 per charged attack. If it contains 3 or more charges, the wave destroys fragile structures in the area (solid structures if you accumulate 5 or more charges).

## Rank IV

<u>Storm rider:</u> You are able to use your elemental attacks to propel yourself long distances. Instead of attacking you can propel yourself 60 feet in a linear using an elemental attack. This counts as a charge, and if anywhere along the line you hit a creature you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage but can immediately make an elemental attack on it (it can still dodge).

<u>Call lightning:</u> You have the ability to contain electrical energy and release it later. This works as a destructive wave, but when you release your energy you make a lightning attack for each accumulated attack. Each lightning bolt fires in the direction you choose, and if two can in the same direction combine into a single attack that will do +1 base damage and increase your range by 15 feet. If you are in a storm you can cause these accumulated lightning bolts to fall from the sky, striking creatures of your choice.

## Rank V 

Add a proficiency die to all your elemental attacks.

<u>Divine lightning:</u> Your electrical attacks pass through resistances and do +2 damage against creatures that wounded you the previous round.

<u>Storm of Vengeance:</u> As a full turn action you summon a cataclysmic storm capable of wiping out everything around you. To use this ability there must be stormy weather and it will last active 10 rounds.This storm grants you the following benefits:

- All creatures cannot make ranged attacks and it is impossible to concentrate while the storm is still active.
- Heavy rain reduces visibility to 15 feet and all creatures other than water or air elementalists move at half speed.
- You can make a lightning, thunder or air elemental attack as a bonus action once per turn.
