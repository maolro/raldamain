## Rank I 

Add a hit die to all your elemental attacks.

<u>Elemental Attack:</u> As a standard action you can launch a powerful torrent of water that pushes your targets. This attack will push your target 5 feet in one direction for each success generated on hit. If he hits a solid surface he will suffer [fall](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/reglas%20de%20combate.html#ca%C3%ADdas) damage as if he had fallen from a height equal to the number of feet of movement he failed to travel (e.g., if he is pushed 30 feet and crashes after 10 feet of thrust, he will suffer damage as if he had fallen 20 feet). To throw your target in a vertical direction it is necessary to spend a number of generated advantages equal to or greater than the target's strength. This attack counts as a combat maneuver for the purposes of [heroism](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#hero%C3%ADsmo-fue) and you roll your elemental attack dice for it.

<u>State Change</u>: You have the ability to change the state of water, transforming it into ice or steam, thus being able to unlock ranks in [elemental ice magic](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20hielo.html). As a standard action you can turn an amount of water with volume equal to 10 x rank cubic feet into mist, obscuring an area of corresponding size and removing that amount of water. 

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. This ability can be used to attack all creatures within 10 feet (30 feet if you are surrounded by water) or a line 10 feet wide and 60 feet long. At rank II you can use this ability to add an additional attack to your reserve without the need to expend actions. Energy reserve can only be used once per turn.

<u>Elemental parry:</u> Your elemental parry allows you to protect yourself from enemy attacks. An elemental parry is a reaction that allows you to use your attack dice defensively to defend yourself from attacks. You can only protect yourself from other elemental attacks or ranged attacks, being able to cancel a success once per turn. At Rank III you can use Elemental Parry against melee attacks and cancel a hit once per turn (two additional times at Rank V).

## Rank II

<u>Water Dance:</u> Instead of making an elemental attack you can store it to increase the strength of your next attack, adding it to your water reserve. The reserve can store at most a number of attacks equal to your elemental magic rank + 1 and you will lose all attacks in your reserve if you are unfocused. As a bonus action you can reduce your reserve by 1 to increase the size of your attack by 5 feet and add an Advantage die to it or make an additional elemental attack as a bonus action. The attacks you have in reserve bolster your defense, granting you one Disadvantage die to defensive shots for each attack you have stored in this way. You can also employ one of your elemental attacks to make a Wall of Water as a reaction without the need to expend disadvantage, which will remain active for one round.

<u>Water wall:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall of roaring water with length equal to 15 x rank feet long and height equal to 5 x rank feet. The wall prevents projectiles from passing through and a creature must spend a move action to pass through it, causing it to have to roll [heroism](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#hero%C3%ADsmo-fue) against your elementalism dice (it need not roll if it spends a standard action and has strength equal to or greater than your charisma). The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you try to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage each turn you keep both walls active. The wall is destroyed if it is turned into gas with the Change of State ability or stops a fire elemental attack that affects an area larger than 15 square feet. Water wall can be created as a reaction by spending 2 disadvantage generated on an elemental parry.

## Rank III

Add a fluency die to all your elemental attacks.

<u>Raring Currents:</u> As a standard action you can increase the strength of the currents in the water where you are, adding a challenge die to swim rolls and turning the water into difficult terrain. Upon hitting with an elemental attack from an area greater than the size of your target you can spend 2 generated perks to [grapple](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#agarrada) your target with the waters. A creature grappled in this way will suffer 2 non-lethal damage per turn and will be at risk of drowning.

<u>Fluid attacks:</u> By concentrating on an attack you can prevent it from disappearing after being used, maintaining a constant whip of water. When making an elemental attack you can spend a move action to prevent it from disappearing, thus avoiding reducing your reserve. In subsequent turns you can make a second attack a turn without the need to spend actions as long as you keep your concentration on it (you cannot store more than one attack this way). Adding attacks to the Water Dance reserve now only costs you one move action.

## Rank IV

<u>Vortex:</u> Employing a standard action you can form a 30-foot radius vortex in a body of water of your choice. All creatures in the vortex must roll strength or they will be caught by the currents, suffering 2 non-lethal damage per turn and being dragged 10 feet toward the center of the vortex. When they reach the center they will immediately begin to drown. You can spend 2 attacks from your reserve or suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the radius of the vortex by 10 feet.

<u>Water bubbles:</u> As a standard action you can form a bubble the size of a human head that allows anyone who comes into contact with it to breathe underwater. A water bubble can also be employed offensively, allowing you to spend 2 perks generated from an elemental attack to fill a target's lungs with water, giving them the status effect [nausea](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#n%C3%A1useas) for one turn (4 perks to start drowning). If your target is grabbed by one of your attacks you can use a move action to reduce the number of turns he can hold his breath by 1.

## V Rank

Add a looseness die to all your elemental attacks.

<u>Tsunami:</u> As a full turn action you can form a devastating tsunami in a region. To use this ability you must spend 6 attacks stored in your reserve and be in contact with the sea. The tsunami functions as a wave 30 feet high and 100 feet wide and will move 30 feet per turn, devastating all weak structures in its path. Creatures in the wave must roll strength or suffer 5 non-lethal damage and be swept away by the wave, suffering 2 non-lethal damage per turn and being at risk of drowning. If a creature inside the wave collides with a solid surface it will suffer [fall](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/reglas%20de%20combate.html#ca%C3%ADdas) damage as if it had traveled a height of 30 feet.

<u>Control Weather:</u> You are able to manipulate the water in clouds to cause changes in the weather, unlocking the [storm magic](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20tormenta.html) branch. By employing a 10 min ritual you can call a deluge to your region, which will cause an intense rain that grants concealment to all creatures. While in the deluge the radius of your attacks will increase by 10 feet and each turn your water reserve is automatically restored by 1. If you have ranks in ice magic this ability allows you to form a [snowstorm](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20hielo.html#rango-iii) while in terrain where it is likely to occur.
