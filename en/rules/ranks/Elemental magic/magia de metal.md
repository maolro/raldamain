## Rank I

Add one hit die to all your elemental attacks.

<u>Elemental attack</u>: Attack the target with a metallic projectile. This attack does 2+success physical damage, which is piercing, blunt or slashing depending on the object you use to attack. You gain the skill [fierce slash](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/filos%20cortantes.html#rango-i) when attacking with cutting objects, [deadly aim](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/arcos.html#rango-i) when attacking with piercing objects and [shock impact](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Armas/contundentes.html#rango-i) if you attack with blunt objects. In all cases you can spend 4 generated perks to inflict a light permanent wound.

<u>Control metal</u>: You are able to manipulate metal objects within 30 feet. As a move action you can move a small metal object out of position up to 15 feet in any direction. To manipulate metal objects carried by a person, you must succeed on an elemental magic roll against his [heroism](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#hero%C3%ADsmo-fue) roll. If you succeed you can disarm him or reduce the effectiveness of the object he is carrying by 1. This ability does not work on magical metals or special materials such as adamantine.

<u>Elemental overflow</u>: You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. With this ability you can make a second elemental attack or increase the area of effect one attack by 5 feet. This ability can only be used once per turn.

<u>Elemental Parry:</u> You can use your element to protect yourself from enemy attacks. An elemental parry is a reaction that allows you to use your attack dice defensively to defend against attacks. You can only protect yourself from other elemental attacks or ranged attacks, being able to cancel a success once per turn. At Rank III you can use Elemental Parry against melee attacks and cancel a hit once per turn (two additional times at Rank V).

## Rank II

<u>Earth Synergy</u>: If you have ranks in [earth elemental magic](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20tierra.html), you can manipulate metal objects with the skills [earth control](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20tierra.html#rango-ii) and [stone wall](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20tierra.html#rango-ii). Skills that strengthen your elemental attacks such as [mountain form](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20tierra.html#rango-ii) or [wait and strike](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Elementalismo/magia%20de%20tierra.html#rango-iii) can also be employed on metal elemental attacks. In case you do not possess the earthbending skill you receive the ability to manipulate a total volume of metal objects equal to 5 x your elemental magic rank, forming difficult terrain, barriers, elevations or holes in places of your choice.

<u>Magnetism</u>: Your body is able to hold metals in a magnetic aura, allowing you to use them to hurt your enemies or protect yourself from attacks. When you attract a metal object to your position using Metal Control you can add it to your magnetic aura, thus being able to grapple a maximum number of objects equal to your Rank + 1. Add one Disadvantage die to your Elemental Parry rolls for each metallic object in your aura. In addition, any creature passing through a space within 10 feet of you must roll dodge or suffer physical damage equal to the number of object trapped in your aura (this damage will be automatic if it ends its turn adjacent to you).

## Rank III

Add a hit die to all your elemental attacks. Making an elemental attack costs you a move action.

<u>Strengthen Attacks:</u> You can use a move action to increase the strength of an elemental attack, increasing its size by 5 feet and its base damage by 1. Using this ability costs you a bonus action if you use one of the metallic objects trapped in your magnetic aura to increase its strength.

<u>Ferrokinesis</u>: As a standard action you can telekinetically grapple a creature wearing metal armor or made of metal, rolling your elemental magic dice against its [heroism](https://raldamain.com/rules/Crear%20personajes/talentos.html#hero%C3%ADsmo-fue). You can spend an advantage generated in this way to move the target 5 feet in any direction or push it against a surface, dealing damage as if [falling](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/reglas%20de%20combate.html#ca%C3%ADdas) a number of feet equal to the number of feet it is pushed.

## Rank IV

<u>Metal spikes:</u> On hit with an elemental attack you can spend 2 generated perks to stab it with a metal thorn. The thorn will cause [bleed](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#sangrado) to the target and you receive a die advantage on attack rolls against it for each thorn it has stuck. A creature that has thorns stuck in it counts as wearing metal armor for the purposes of the Ferrokinesis ability. Removing a metal thorn requires spending a move action, but doing so will cause the affected creature to suffer immediate bleed damage when it is pulled out.

<u>Deflect attacks</u>: When an enemy attacks you with a metallic weapon and you succeed at the defensive roll, you can spend 2 Disadvantages generated to trap their weapon in your Magnetic Aura. If it is a melee weapon, your target may roll their attack dice against your Elemental Magic roll to avoid being disarmed. You may also spend 2 generated Disadvantages to make an elemental attack with an object trapped in your Magnetic Aura as a reaction.

## Rank V

Add a casting bonus die to all your elemental attacks. Once per turn you may make an additional attack as a bonus action.

<u>Death Strike</u>: As a full turn action you can make a coup de grace against a target that is wearing metal armor or has a metal thorn stuck in it. This ability functions as a metal elemental attack but your target will not be able to defend himself and the permanent wounds you inflict will be of a higher level. You cannot use this ability on the same target unless you stick another metal thorn in them. 

<u>Metal Mastery</u>: You ignore your target's defense granted by metal armor as long as he is wearing a metal you can manipulate. In addition, you can use a standard action to destroy a 15-foot radius surface made of metallic materials.
