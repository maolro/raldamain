## Rank I

Add a proficiency die to all of your elemental attacks.	

<u>Elemental attack:</u> As a standard action you can attack a target by throwing a stone at it at high speed. The stone does damage depending on its size, with 1+success concussive damage, being the damage a medium sized stone (5 cubic feet) would do. The stone will impact in an area equal in size to the stone, you can spend a generated advantage to trip the target or push it 5 feet in any direction. This counts as a combat technique for which the resistances granted by heroism will apply.

<u>Elemental parry:</u> You parry attacks with your element. An elemental parry is a reaction which allows you to use your attack dice defensively. You can protect yourself from all attacks, once per turn you can cancel a generated success (2 times at Rank III and 3 times at Rank V).

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. With this, you can increase the size of your stone by 5 cubic feet (+1 base damage), make an additional attack or destroy a block of petrous material of size 10 square feet. Energy reservoir can only be used once per turn.

## Rank II

<u>Stone wall:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall made of solid stones with length equal to 15 x rank feet long and height equal to 5 x rank feet. This wall is a barrier that grants full cover to all creatures behind it (it will grant partial cover if they try to attack from behind the wall). The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you attempt to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage each turn you keep both walls active. Each 10 square foot section of the wall has HP equal to 4 + your elementalism rank and 3 defense. Wall of stone can be created as a reaction by spending 2 disadvantage generated in an elemental parry.

<u>Ground control:</u> You are able to manipulate the earth beneath your feet. As a standard action you can manipulate a total volume of earth equal to 5 x your elemental magic rank, shaping it as you wish. With this ability you can create difficult terrain, barriers, elevations or holes in any place you wish. The height and depth of these obstacles may not exceed 5 feet and they grant cover to creatures behind them.

<u>Form of the mountain:</u> Your attacks are strengthened by standing still. You can use a movement action to increase the size of your elemental attack by 5 feet (this will also increase its base damage by 1) or make an additional attack with an area of impact equal to 5 feet. At rank III this ability allows you to increase the size by 10 feet and at rank V you can increase it by 15 feet.

## Rango III

Add a proficiency die to all of your elemental attacks. Increase your base damage by 1 and the radius of your attacks by 5 feet.

<u>Earthen grasp:</u> When you hit with an elemental attack you can spend 2 generated advantages to wrap a part of your target's body with stone, keeping him in your grip. The target will not be able to free himself from the grip unless he destroys the earth that imprisons him (it has 4 defense and life equal to your rank x 2) or succeeds in a Shatter roll against your elemental attack.

<u>Wait and strike:</u> You have mastered the art of waiting patiently for the right opportunity, resisting blows until your enemy commits a fatal flaw. If you take the full defense action and generate 2 disadvantages on the defense roll you can perform an elemental attack as a reaction against your enemy. You can spend 2 additional disadvantages to make this attack count as a feint, thus preventing your enemy from being able to defend himself.

## Rango IV

<u>Avalanche:</u> As a full turn action you can cause an avalanche in a space composed mainly of earth, such as a cave or a building. All creatures in that space must roll DEX against your elemental attack dice or they will suffer 6+Success concussive damage and end up trapped by the earth. You can spend 2 generated advantages to bury them underground, which will allow them to risk suffocation..

<u>Stone spikes:</u> You can deal piercing damage with elemental attacks. The piercing damage does +1 base damage and your permanent wounds are 1 level higher. When using ground control you can fill an area with spikes, which will inflict 2 non-lethal damage to creatures attempting to pass through and turn the area into Difficult Terrain.

## Rango V

Add a proficiency die to all of your elemental attacks. Increase your base damage by 1 and the radius of your attacks by 5 feet.

<u>Earthquake:</u> As a full turn action you can release a 60 foot radius shockwave. All creatures located in that space must roll strength or they will immediately fall to the ground, and buildings in that area will collapse if they are made of stone or other brittle material (particularly large or solid buildings cannot be destroyed by this effect, although they will suffer slight structural damage). The area affected by earthquake will become difficult terrain.

<u>Chasm:</u> As a full turn action you can form a deep chasm 60 feet long and 30 feet deep. All creatures in the area must roll Dexterity or fall into it, suffering the corresponding fall damage. Those creatures within a breach may be affected by a Landslide. Breach can only be used once per day.
