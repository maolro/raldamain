## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with elemental earth magic.

<u>Flame strike:</u> As a standard action you can strike a target with a searing flare. The flame deals 1d6 + CHA fire damage and you can whenever you deal hit point damage your target will suffer a mild burn (medium burn on a critical hit). All flammable objects in the area of effect this attack will catch fire, which will spread at a rate of 5 feet per round until they are extinguished. A creature with no fire resistance which passes through an area on fire will automatically suffer a mild burn. An uncontrolled fire may eventually result in a wildfire.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to take 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. This ability can be used to increase the spash radius of an attack by 10 feet, do an additional attack per turn or attack all targets in a 15-foot cone. At rank III you can use this ability to store an additional attack without the need to expend actions. Elemental overflow can only be used once per turn.

<u>Elemental Parry:</u> You are capable of using your element to defend yourself from attacks, which is known as an elemental parry. You can only protect yourself with this ability from elemental, magic or ranged attacks (at rank III this ability can be used to defend yourself against melee attacks).

## Rank II

<u>Flurry of blows:</u>  Making elemental attacks now cost you a move action instead of a standard action. You also gain advantage when attacking targets that already suffer from a burn.

<u>Wall of Fire:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall of raging flame 15 x rank feet long and 5 x rank feet high. The wall grants cover to creatures behind it from projectiles and magical attacks, and a anyone who attempts to pass through the wall of fire must succeed in an acrobatics check or it will suffer 1 fire damage and a medium burn (on success it will suffer a mild burn). The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you try to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage at the beginning of your turn if you keep both walls active. Wall of fire can be created as a reaction by expending 2 energy points at rank III.

<u>Scorching Flames:</u> Whenever you strike a target's head with a flame attack it will become blinded for a round (this blindness will last 2 rounds if it already suffers from a medium burn and it will become permanent if it suffers from a severe burn). Additionally, whenever you hit a target wearing metal armor with an elemental attack all burn effects on it will increase their level by one step.

## Rank III

Increase your critical threshold to 19-20.

<u>Overcharge:</u> Instead of making an elemental attack you can store its energy in your body to release it later. Each attack you store grants you one energy point, reaching a maximum number of energy points equal to your fire magic rank + 1. Whenever you make an elemental attack you can spend any numeber energy points to increase the strength of your attack. Each energy point spent this way will increase your base damage by 2 and your splash radius by 5 feet. If you lose concentration while storing energy it will be released in a devastating explosion that deals 1d6 + number of energy points fire damage to all creatures in a radius equal to 5 x number of energy points. You will also suffer non-lethal damage equal to 2 + the number of energy points from this explosion.

<u>Pyrotechnics:</u> As a standard action you can manipulate flames in a 10 x rank area. For this ability you can choose up to 3 + rank sources of fire and increase or decrease the area they affect by 5 feet. If you affect an area occupied by another creature with this ability it must succeed in a DEX roll or suffer a mild burn.

## Rank IV

<u>Redirect Fire:</u> Whenever you successfully parry a fire elemental attack while in defensive position you can choose to redirect it in a direction of choice. A redirected attack has a maximum range of 15 feet (30 feet if you roll critical defense) and you will roll your elemental attack modifier for it (you can also spend energy points to reinforce this attack).

<u>Flame Mastery:</u> Your fire attacks can take a variety of deadly forms. When you make an elemental attack you can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage or spend a stored attack to modify it in one of the following ways: 

- **Fireball:** Increases the splash area by 10 feet.
- **Fire whip**: Attacks all creatures in a 30-foot line.
- **Flame descent**: Attacks all creatures in a cylinder with a diameter of 15 feet and a height of 30 feet.
- **Fire Snake**: Your fire attack will remain after attacking and as long as you maintain concentration you can attack with it as a bonus action. You cannot sustain more than one attack in this manner.

## Rank V

Increase your critical threshold to 18-20.

<u>Rain of Embers:</u> As a full-round action you can create a storm of raging flames expending 6 stored attacks. This attack will fill up to 5 10-foot wide cubes with flames, dealing 2d6 + CHA fire damage to all creatures in the area and inflicting a medium burns to all targets you strike. In addition, all areas you strike will be filled with a wall of flames which will last until the next round. 

<u>Pureflame:</u> The fire damage from your attacks is capable of ignoring resistances and all burn effects you inflict will increase their severity by one step (this does not affect rain of embers). Creatures with fire resistances still gain bonuses in defense rolls to avoid status effects from your abilities.
