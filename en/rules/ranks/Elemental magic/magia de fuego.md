## Rank I

Add your rank to all attack and defense rolls made with elemental earth magic.

<u>Flame strike:</u> As a standard action you can attack a target with a searing flare. The flame deals 3+success fire damage and you can spend 2 generated perks to cause a [mild burn](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#quemada) (4 perks to cause a [medium burn](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20principales/Efectos%20de%20estado.html#quemada)). All flammable objects in the area of effect of the flare will begin to burn, spreading at a rate of 5 feet per round until they are extinguished. A creature with no fire resistance passing through a flaming space will automatically suffer a minor burn. An uncontrolled fire may eventually result in a fire.

<u>Elemental overflow:</u> You can choose to take 2 non-lethal damage to increase the strength of your attacks. This allows you to make an additional elemental attack on your turn, increase the radius of your attack by 10 feet, or cause your attack to have a splash radius of 5 feet. Energy reserve can only be used once per turn.

<u>Elemental Parry:</u> Your elemental allows you to protect yourself from enemy attacks. An elemental parry is a reaction that allows you to use your attack dice defensively to defend against attacks. You can only protect yourself from other elemental attacks or ranged attacks, being able to cancel a success once per turn. At Rank III you can use Elemental Parry against melee attacks and cancel a hit once per turn (two additional times at Rank V).

## Rank II

<u>Flurry of blows:</u> You can use a move action to make an additional elemental attack. Additional move actions granted to you by [fire ascendancy](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Ascendencias/ascendencia%20de%20fuego.html) or [reflexes](https://raldamain.com/rules/Rangos/Combate/reflejos.html) may be used for this ability.

<u>Wall of Fire:</u> As a standard action you can form a wall of raging flame with length equal to 15 x rank feet long and height equal to 5 x rank feet. The wall will protect all creatures behind it from magical attacks and projectiles, allowing you to use your fire elemental magic defensive throw to defend them. All who attempt to pass through the wall of fire will suffer 1 mandatory fire damage and receive a medium burn. A creature can roll Dodge against your elemental magic shot to try to avoid this damage, suffering only a light burn on success (none if it has Evasion). The wall will remain until you lose concentration, and if you attempt to create an additional wall you will suffer 2 non-lethal damage each turn you keep both walls active. Wall of fire can be created as a reaction by spending 2 disadvantage generated in an elemental parry.

<u>Scorching Flames:</u> On hit with your attack you can spend 2 generated buffs to blind the target for one turn. Upon hitting a target wearing metal armor the level of any burns they have will increase by one step (you will receive an additional burn if it is already severe).

## Rank III

Add a fluency die to all your elemental attacks. Increases your base damage by 1.

<u>Overcharge:</u> Instead of making an elemental attack, you can store its energy for later release. Each attack you store grants you one energy point, reaching a maximum number of energy points equal to your fire magic rank + 1. When making an elemental attack you can spend as many energy points to increase the strength of your attack as there are in your reserve. Each energy point spent increases your base damage by 1 and your splash radius by 5 feet. If you lose concentration while holding stored energy it will be released in a devastating explosion that does fire damage to all creatures in a radius equal to 5 x equal energy points and 2 + the number of energy points you have stored fire damage. You will also suffer non-lethal damage equal to 2 + the number of energy points from this explosion.

<u>Pyrotechnics:</u> You unlock the advanced smoke technique. As a standard action you can manipulate the flames to move them at will. The area you can affect equals 10 feet x your elemental magic rank and you can use this ability to make the flames grow or shrink, causing them to inflict more severe or lighter burns (this will reduce or increase the burns produced by a step).

## Rank IV

<u>Redirect Fire:</u> When you successfully parry a fire elemental attack you may spend 2 disadvantage generated as a reaction to redirect the attack to another location of your choice. You may spend any energy points you have to strengthen this attack.

<u>Flame Mastery:</u> Your fire attacks can take a variety of deadly forms. When you make an elemental attack you can choose to suffer 2 non-lethal damage to modify it in one of the following ways: 

- **Fireball:** Increases the splash area by 10 feet.
- **Fire whip**: Attacks all creatures in a 30-foot line.
- **Flame descent**: Attacks all creatures in a cylinder with a diameter of 15 feet and a height of 30 feet.
- **Fire Snake**: Your fire attack will remain after attacking and as long as you maintain concentration you can attack with it as a bonus action. You cannot sustain more than one attack in this manner.

## V Rank

Add a looseness die to all your elemental attacks. Increases your base damage by 1.

<u>Rain of Embers:</u> As a full turn action you can fill up to 5 10-foot-wide cubes with roaring flames. This attack functions as an elemental attack made against all creatures in that area and fills it with fire, which will immediately cause a fire. You must wait 4 turns until you use this ability again, and you can reduce the waiting time by one turn by taking 1 non-lethal damage

<u>Pure Fire:</u> Your fire attacks pass through resistances. Increase the level of burns you inflict by one step and you can spend 2 perks generated with an attack to knock your target out of focus or remove a magical effect affecting them.
