## Rank I

<u>Warrior of the faith:</u> You are blessed by your god in battle. Add one Boost die to attack rolls against enemies of your faith and +1 defense against physical and magical attacks. This ability does not count as magic for the purposes of Dispel Magic.

<u>Combat Healer:</u> You have the ability to channel divine energy to heal your allies. When you make a First Aid roll to heal an ally you will recover Vitality equal to your Divine Warrior rank + 2. If you are at maximum Vitality then the appropriate amount of HP will be recovered. Once per day you can reduce the level of a permanent wound on a target by 1. You receive an additional use of this ability at Rank III and Rank V.

## Rank II

<u>Sacred weapon:</u> Your weapon deals +2 base damage against creatures blessed by enemy gods. With this ability you can affect priests, divine warriors and monstrous creatures associated with rival religions. Upon hitting an enemy of the faith you can spend 2 advantages so that it cannot heal damage for one turn.

<u>Consecrated armor:</u> Your armor is blessed by your god. Blessed armor gives you +1 DEF and increases your magical resistance by a value equal to your rank in divine warrior. 

## Rank III

<u>Prayer:</u> Before a battle, you can perform a prayer to your god along with your allies to grant them luck in battle. All those who perform the prayer receive one Advantage die and +1 defense against enemies of the faith for the rest of the day.

<u>Guardian of faith:</u> As a standard action, you can allow divine energy to flow through your body, giving you supernatural strength. Guardian of faith increases your strength and constitution by 1 (you can exceed 6 with this ability) and gives you Resistance 2 against physical damage. Your resistance can only be pierced by holy weapons. This ability deals 1 non-lethal damage each turn you have it activated and deactivating it is a free action.

## Rank IV

<u>Breath of Life:</u> Your god grants you the ability to resurrect those killed in combat to continue the holy war. As a full turn action, resurrect a creature killed in combat. The dead creature is resurrected to 1 HP, but retains all of its permanent wounds. This ability can only be used R-2 times per day and the dead creature must have died no more than one minute ago. You cannot resurrect creatures missing vital organs or head.

<u>Divine Host:</u> You have a 15-foot aura that strengthens your companions, granting them resistance 2 against mental effects, fear and physical weapons, +1 FUE and CON. Creatures in the aura of more than one divine host do not accumulate their effects but use the one with the highest value. This aura is activated when using the Guardian of Faith effect.

## Rank V

Roll an additional challenge die on defensive wisdom rolls.

<u>Holy Aura:</u> You are a living saint of your faith. When you use the guardian of faith ability you add a proficiency die to all your attacks and activate a 20-foot divine aura. All creatures in the aura are immune to mental and possession effects caused by evil creatures and gain Resistance 4 against physical and magical attacks (if they already have resistance, they keep the higher value). Sacred aura is deactivated together with guardian of faith.

<u>Divine Intervention:</u> When you are in a moment of greatest danger you can call upon your god to save you. This ability can only be used once per day and when you are at 3 or less HP. Divine Intervention does one of the following effects:

- You are healed of all your vitality, 6 HP and removes all status effects you have.
- A group of up to 6 allies who died at most one minute ago are resurrected with 3 HP and receive the ability Warrior of Faith.
- Your god sends his forces to protect you. Summon a group of extraplanar creatures of the same level as you.
- You receive warrior knowledge from your god, allowing you to roll three dice of proficiency with any weapon and granting you three new weapon attributes.
