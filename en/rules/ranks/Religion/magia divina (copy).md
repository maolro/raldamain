# Ranks

## Rank I

<u>Minor Miracle:</u> Your deity allows you to give minor curses and blessings to creatures of your choice. As a one-time usable bonus action you may give one Advantage or Disadvantage die on your next roll to a creature of your choice. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to your Rank + 2. Minor Miracle can also be used to receive a small non-combat related boon from your god.

<u>Envoy of the gods:</u> You have great knowledge of your religious doctrine and the secrets of your faith. You know how to speak an additional language related to your divinity and creatures related to it will treat you as if you were one of them. In addition, you unlock an ancestry related to your god and you can use your wisdom stat for arcane or elemental magic rolls. In addition, each god allows you to spend your reserve chi in unique ways as specified in their respective sections.

<u>Prayer:</u> By spending ten minutes in prayer and contemplation you can communicate directly with your god, receiving his advice. Prayer allows you to ask up to 4 questions to your god, who will answer you truthfully. However, your god may speak to you cryptically or not answer certain questions. The master will decide how your god will answer you. Each successive time on the same day you use prayer reduces the number of questions you can ask your god by 1.

## Rank II

<u>Divine Manifestation:</u> You can use a standard action to bless or punish a creature of your choice. If you choose to bless your target will recover from a status effect, curse, or [disease](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/venenos_enfermedades.html#enfermedades) affecting it, receive a +1 bonus on a stat for one hour, or increase its resistance to an element or status effect by 2. Alternatively, if you choose to punish the creature will receive a -1 penalty on a stat of your choice, reduce one of its resistances by 2 (it receives vulnerability if you reduce it to 0) or suffer a [disease](https://raldamain.com/rules/Reglas%20adicionales/venenos_enfermedades.html#enfermedades) or status effect (the status effect will last for three turns or until it recovers from it). If you choose to cast a curse your target can defend himself with a Wisdom roll against your divine magic dice. Divine Manifestation can only be used a number of times per day equal to your rank (2 additional times if you are on consecrated ground).

<u>Consecrate:</u> You know how to invoke the power of your god in a region, strengthening the followers of that god and harming non-believers. Consecrating is an hour-long ceremony and depending on the divinity may require a specific sacrifice. While on consecrated ground the worshippers of your faith receive an additional Advantage die on all your rolls and extraplanar creatures of enemy religions may not be summoned there. In addition, your god can exert his influence in this area and intervene more directly in case of great need. This ability can also be used to eliminate areas that are consecrated to other gods.  

## Rank III

<u>Divine Punishment:</u> Once per day you can unleash a horrifying curse on a target. The curse varies depending on your god, but these are some of the possibilities:

- **Insect plague:** Summons a giant swarm of insects that attacks enemies of your faith.
- **Mark of law**: The target must refrain from a behavior or obey an order. If he fails to do so, he will temporarily reduce one of his stats by one each day he continues to disobey you. 
- **Nightmares**: The target is afflicted with horrible nightmares. He cannot receive the benefits of a long rest and suffers 3 sanity damage per day.
- **Pain**: The target feels extreme pain all over his body. He can only take one action per turn and suffers 1 non-lethal damage per turn. This effect lasts for one minute and will repeat each day until the curse is removed.

<u>Rituals of faith:</u> You know how to perform secret rituals of your faith. A ritual is a spell that requires at least 6 rounds of concentration and several rare material components. You can create your own rituals, but you must first check with the master if they are allowed. If you also possess the Ritualist skill you will unlock superior rituals and learn an additional spell of your own creation of rank III or less.

## Divinities

## Main gods

These divinities have a particularly extensive cult and bless their followers to achieve their will in the world.

### Feyn

<u>Dominion</u>: God of humanity, progress and law.

<u>Centers of worship</u>: Ustilus, Kratoi, Mazarin and Pradjati. He is also the chief divinity of the distant continent of Eshanda and it is believed that the lost nation of Nekthys worshipped him. After Feyn's death all these places eventually lost faith and worshipped other gods.

<u>Ideals</u>: Pursuit of the common good. Feyn's laws are the most perfect and all must follow them. Mankind must be united under a single nation. The other gods are enemies of humanity and seek to dominate it. A just life is that which contributes most to the advancement of humanity.

<u>Uses of chi:</u> Feyn's gifts let you spend chi to empower yourself and your allies, granting them divine strength and insight. Once per turn you can spend 1 chi to give all allies within 20 feet one boost die in all their attack rolls and one setback die in all their defensive rolls for the rest of the round. At rank II of divine magic you can spend 2 chi so all allies in that area increase up to 2 stats of their choice by 1 and at rank III you can spend 3 chi so they gain +2 DEF, +2 damage and +2 resistance to a type of damage of their choice in addition to all other bonuses. These effects will last while you maintain concentration and they stack with similar bonuses given by Divine warrior and Presence.

### Mekhatim

<u>Dominion</u>: Goddess of justice, holy war and salvation.

<u>Centers of worship</u>: Arshalan, Menadar, some regions of the Free Kingdoms.

<u>Ideals</u>: Life in all its forms is sacred. Every good deed will be rewarded, every evil will be punished. Every person in the world must convert to the faith to bring salvation. No compromise with evil is allowed, although sincere redemption should be accepted.

<u>Uses of chi:</u> Mekhatim's power lets you to infuse life energy in chi to heal your allies. You can spend 1 chi from your reserve to heal vitality to an ally equal to your divine magic rank + 1 (in case it is at maximum vitality it will heal HP). At rank II of divine magic you can spend 2 chi to remove a status effect, poison or disease affecting an ally and at rank III you can spend 3 chi to resurrect an ally who died less than a minute ago.

### Sek-Tebos

<u>Domain</u>: God of order, ambition and the underworld.

<u>Cults</u>: His secret cults abound throughout the lands, especially in Ustilus.

<u>Ideals</u>: There is no power without a price. Some people are born to reign and some are others to serve. You can only depend on yourself and your talents. Take advantage of those who are useful and discard those who pose a hindrance. Nature is cruel and there is no reason why human beings should not be.

### Ayanuu

<u>Domain</u>: Primordial entity of chaos, madness and magic.

<u>Worship</u>: The worship of Ayanuu is forbidden in all civilized nations and persecuted by law.

<u>Ideals</u>: Chaos is the beginning, and chaos will be the end. Laws are an artificial construct oppressing human ambition. Gods are insignificant before the pure power of the abyss. No knowledge should be censored. Live in the moment, everything will inevitably die.
